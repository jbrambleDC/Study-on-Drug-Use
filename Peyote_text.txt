Abstract
	'From Notes.At 10 a.m., June 20, 1886, I ate one-third of one of
those buttons, or prickly plants,'--he's referring to Lopophora
willemsii--'and with pencil and paper and watch before me, awaited
results.
In fifteen minutes afterward I felt a slight fulness in my
carotids, and found my pulse had gone from 60 normal to 70.
In
fifteen minutes more the feeling in my head and throat was becoming
very unpleasantone of over- arterial tensionand my pulse had reached

90.
My respirations had gone up to this time from 18 normal to 26.
The unpleasant fulness of my head rapidly increased until 10:45, when
my head began to ache and I felt dizzy.
My pulse had then reached 120
and respirations 30.
Soon after the forty-five minutes had passed a
sudden and alarming jump in my pulse occurredreaching 160.
The
peculiar and dazed feelings I then experienced, together with alarm,
prevented my taking notes on respirations, and therefore dont know
the number, but they had certainly still further increased.
It seemed
to me my heart was simply running away with itself, and it was with
considerable difficulty I could breathe air enough to keep me alive.
I
felt intoxicated, and for a short time particularly lost
consciousness.
Automatically I rushed to my able friend, Dr. E. J.
Beall, of Fort Worthmy residence at the time.
After giving him an
idea, as best I could, of the trouble, he prescribed aro.
spts.
ammonia and whiskey, in large doses, every few minutes.
This I took,
if I remember right, one hour after having taken the muscale button.
It seemed necessary for me to walk in the open air for me to breathe.
In about half an hour I felt some relief, and my pulse and
respirations gradually became less until in about six or eight hours
they were about normal.
No bad consequences followed.
I did, however,
feel much depressed for about twelve hoursa feeling of malaise.
The
recollection of such experience is vividly impressed upon my mind.
I
believe if prompt aid had not been given me I should have died.
.
.
.
Whatever may be the ultimate constituents of this poison, it certainly
is the most violent and rapid of all fruits, or even medicines, known
to memanifesting its first effects in less than fifteen minutes.
I
know of nothing like it except opium and cocaine.
The most notable
point is the rapidity with which it increases the hearts action.
Next, the intoxication and subsequent depression.
I think it well
worth the trouble to investigate the matter.
One mans experience is
worth but little, and it is to be hoped some enterprising experimenter
will carry out the research.
As to myself, I must admit I feel
somewhat abstemious on the subject.
'
--John Raleigh Briggs, 1887

At the begining, right when it touches my mouth, I immedeately start to feel different.
I don't eat all 24-26 buttons at once, I I start out with about 2 fresh buttons that I chewed, they were cleaned (the Fuzz or Hairs were removed), then right after I ate about 4 teaspoonfuls of very dry finely grounded powder, then came the mush about another 4 teaspoonfuls, then throughout the night they will pass the peyote around and I came up with about 24-26 buttons but probably more like 30-34 buttons.
This is a very high dosage, I eat this plant quite often just about 2 times per month for the past 10 years sometimes I eat it every weekend for months straight.
Within the first 10-20 mins, I can feel my stomache start to ache, I start to belch a lot.
Slowly I start to feel the effects.
20-60 mins later, I start noticing that all light and objects seem to be more intense.
Everything starts to look sharp and bright.
1 Hour to 2 hours, I start to feel a lot of nausea, but I don't feel like puking, I probably would have if I would have made any sudden moves, I start noticing my thoughts start to move around more and they start to come alive, when I close my eyes I start to see blue, orange, Green, and red designs that are very brightly colored.
The designs that I start to see are very geometrical, and I start to even see the designs starting to form people and objects along with other things.
I can't keep my eyes open at this point as I can't keep my eyes in one place they start moving a lot, and I prefer to close in case they start to roll back and I start to freak out people.
Suddenly I start to go into some deep dream states, it's as if I'm having lucid dreams, they last very short seconds maybe just a second but a lot happens.
I start seeing other people's thoughts expressed to me in the form of dreams, I see intricate details of people, things that they only know.
I start hearing people talk to me in the dreams.
I start flying to the universe and I see bright bright colors now, the designs move slowly and not fast contantly changing like mushrooms do to me.
I see colored lights pass over me as if I'm flying in the universe filled with bright stars.
I suddenly find myself in a world where everything is crystal, and I see holy beings that look like Hopi Kachinas and a mixture of Northwestern totem poles a long with a japanese feel.
I start to receive info about my life and how to become a better person, I learn ways on how to be in life, humble, loving.
How to pray better, how to heal, how to find a better job, right decisions.
I moved around into different worlds and different thoughts.
Now 3-4 hours I've eaten the rest of the peyote, at this point i'm very nauseas and can't move much, I feel heavy and I see a lot of things now, I feel very emotional, and I feel like I want to stand up, but I can't, I still feel a lot of peyote in my stomache and I'm belching a lot now.
I now get the guts to walk around, the clouds are moving fast and I see bright colors everywhere.
Symbols, I start to hear a vibration, and I hear things in a different language, my thoughts sound like a different language, it's like a code, and I start to understand it clear, I learn the most beautiful things and some very bizarre understandings that make so much sense but there are no words to express this spiritual connection, but I've understood it quickly, I know that these teachings are a part of me even though I forget after this dosage.
I don't feel safe walking alone so I go back in the teepee and feel good.
I feel so happy, I can't take off this smile, I continue to feel like this, I see designs of many things.
Six hours later the nausea is almost gone but it comes in waves.
The peyote is still working on me very strong, 10-12 hours later I feel fine, still feel good and the effects slowly will go away.
I feel like a new person, I feel good alive and get this, days later I got what I asked the peyote to help me get.
The peyote told me it would be 4 days, and I got exactly four days later...what a good blessing.
I do not recommend this dosage, however I feel most people can't OD because one would most likely puke before they OD.
Be careful with this though it would never hurt ya, but can be quite scare if used incorrectly.
I would recommend not to mix with anything because it is such a potent healing medicine.

This all started around March or so that I obtained some peyote.
I tryed it out thinking it would be some fantastic trip with just hallucinations and goofy hippy shit like that, but no, I was unaware of the power peyote can have on me.
I had absolutly no knowledge about drugs, hell I haven't even smoked weed prior to the time I did this!
No shit.
My friend was supposed to try this with me but his dumbass went to sleep!
He came over for a visit and took 2 tablespoons and stayed up for a lil bit it wasn't effecting us so he just crashed, I tryed to tell him give it some time but he just went to sleep which pissed me off.
I started playing the PS2 to kill time for awhile I played a little of MGS:2 then I felt this rush of energy and I just thought 'It's coming on!
' I quit playing for awhile and just sat down for awhile got some kool-aid and when I started playing the game again it sounded very different.
All the electronic beeping sounds, sounding slowed down, kinda like down an octave like a flat note.
I paused the game and wondered if the stereo was on the fritz then I reseted it.
It sounded really really scary!
I just turned it off and my parents told me to go to bed because I promised to go to church the next morning.
I tried going to sleep but I just couldn't sleep, I didn't feel wierd or high or anything.
My thoughts had more meaning to them.
I was lying there still awake, and I started to get nauseated and real dizzy.
I went to the bathroom to puke.
I puked hard!
My brother came out of his room and asked if I was ok, I told him I was just sick, and he asked me if I wanted the trashcan by my bed and I said yes.
Talking to him was very comforting.
Talking to anyone would've been comforting.
I told him to stay and talk longer I told him I had god awful nightmares and he did stay for a few minutes.
My dad woke up and asked if I was ok.
I said I just felt a little ill.
He just told me to drink some water and I did, I felt a world better.
They went back to sleep for awhile.
I just layed in my bed, I closed my eyes and I started to see thoughts take a visible image.
Just thoughts that manifested themselves upon me involuntarily.
I started to think about this one girl I never pay any recognition to.
Her face popped up and then she turned into like some skeleton that resembled a bug but still retained her facial image.
It was letting out some eery low screech (yes it was a low screech).
This scared the living shit outa me!
I ran to the bathroom and I looked at the mirror and my face was all contorted and didn't look right.
I got real scared and started praying to god.
This comforted me a little but everytime I looked into the mirror I just looked strange.
I still looked the same but I could see myself as I really was.
It was like my inner-beauty (actually innerugly) was surfacing.
I never noticed how many pimples I had, how oily  my skin was or how crappy I looked.
I never thought highly of myself but man, just when you thought you couldn't look any worse!
This all scared me deeply and I just prayed asking for it to end.
I tried playing some more games but the games were just too intense and took on a whole new meaning that wasn't appealing to me.
Just when I turned it off my dad asked if I could keep it down.
I said ok and my friend woke up and I told him how hard I was tripping he really didn't seem to be fascinated which seemed really odd to me.
We started talking for awhile and I begged him to not go back to sleep.
But he was being all bitchy and threatened me and I told him to chill out.
He did,he was just cranky from waking up he didn't seem to realize the seriousness of the situation.
It wasn't affecting him any(the peyote that is).
He gave me some sleeping pills and told me to chill out.
I was afraid to take them for fear that they would fuck me up even more, but he said they wouldn't and he wouldn't give me anything that would kill me.
I took his word for it and took them.
He went back to bed.
I layed down for what seemed like hours.
New songs of different genres played in my head, they sounded out of this world.
I didn't like it.
I looked at my hand under the covers and It looked very very odd.
It terrified me alot cause it started bleeding I looked away immediately cause it seemd so real.
I knew it was a hallucination.
I started telling myself of how stupid I was for even wanting to try this.
The effects were starting to taper off and I got tired and slept.
I didn't see any crazy geometric patterns or any of the crazy stereotypical bullshit I thought I would achieve if I took any psychadelic.
It was more of a mind game that my curiosity had to pay the consequences for.
The setting and mindset was all wrong.
If I could change this trip I would've done it during the day, in nature, away from any electronics and tripping with someone else.
And reduced my doseage.
After this experience, I have come to respect drugs and learned to not be so damn naive.
I finally got over what happened to me.
If it happened again I could handle the situation alot better since I have become a billion times more educated on the matter.

First, let me tell you about myself.
I live in Monterrey,Mexico and have a degree in psychology.
Being Mexican, please excuse any glitch in my English.
On September 16,1999 my brother in law and I took a trip to a town called Real de Catorce.
This little town is lost in the plains of northern central Mexico and is accesible only through a 2 kilometer tunnel.
The area is sacred for the huichol people and they go on a yearly pilgrimage to look for the sacred hicuri (peyote).
I was surprised the first time I went there to find many Americans and Europeans living there (this was my fourth trip, but the most interesting one).
Since my first trip I had been very curious about the peyote,but I was a little scared about it.
Fortunately on this particular time I met a man called El Camaron (shrimp in English)and we started talking about peyote and he turned out to know a great deal about it.
What really convinced my brother in law (his name is Jorge, by the way)and I about trying the peyote was that this man had only good things to say about hicuri.
He told us that we would learn a lot about ourselves and that, if eaten with respect and a purpose, hicuri would be good to us and that if our trip was scary,it would be that way for agood reason.
So Jorge and I decided to try it.
I think it is important to tell you about Jorge.
First of all, he is a great,sensitive guy and we have the best of the friendships, but unfortunately he is not a strong individual, he is a bit clumsy physically and this brought a lot of abuse from other kids when he was younger.We are both thirty-three now.
All of what I have told you and some other things made him a little bit insecure of himself.
On the other hand,I am strong secure of myself and through my life I have practiced extreme sports and things like that, so for Jorge I am like a big brother.
So we headed into the desert with a local guide and took only what we needed then we went to an abandoned mine and set camp.
We ate the peyote with great respect  and just kept talking of ordinary things.
About two hours after we ate the peyote Jorge vomited, but we felt normal.
After maybe another hour I was looking up at some tree branches and they started to turn more dense right in front of my eyes, and I thought 'this is it' at the same time the leaves of the trees started to glow like emeralds and everything exploded in a thousand colors and I felt one with the mountains and my surroundings there is one word to describe it:bliss.
And here comes the learning that the experience gave us,at a given moment I could actually feel terror coming out of Jorge,he did not looked scared at all but his fear was hitting me in the same way as if he were throwing something physical at me,at that time I asked him 'You´re scared shitless, aren´t you?
' And he was astonished that I could feel that because he was not showing any fear at all.I suddenly said,and to this day I do not why, 'You are dealing with your past'.
This made him very anxious and he told me 'How the fuck do you know all about what I am feeling?
How can you be so accurate?
'

To tell you the truth I don't know.
What I can tell you is that I had an incredible mental connection with my friend and I knew he was in trouble facing his demons, but as the hours went by I talked out of his fears and we started to enjoy a state of mind so beautiful so undescribable that to try to explain it would be like explaining a person who was born blind how is the color blue.At about six am we got into the tent and fell asleep.
The next day Jorge told me 'Now I know that I am capable of achieving many things I thought impossible,if I made it through that night in which I faced my deepest fears I can do anything'.
And so it was.
The next day we climbed a mountain and Jorge pitched the tent cut firewood and did things that the previous day he regarded as impossible.
As for me the mental connection was incredible and the feelings beautifuly overwhelming,and there is no doubt in my mind that the experience was one of the most enriching events in my life.
By the way, Jorge is now in college and people respect him a whole lot more than before that night in September 16, 1999.

This passed January, one of my friends (we'll call him Q) My friend Q took a trip down to Mexico with a couple of his other friends.
There he met up with some guy who was willing to take them to the desert to pick some peyote.
The guy told them alot about peyote, he told them to never think of anything as bad because if you did, it would make the trip bad.
Well anyway, Q got back from his trip January 16th around 3 oclock in the afternoon.
He came straight up to my house to let me know he had gotten some peyote and wanted to know if I wanted to try it with him next week.
He said his parents would be out of town so we could do it at his house with no chance of getting caught.
I had never done peyote before but I had read quite a bit about it and it sounded like a fun thing to do, so I said that I would and that I'd see him next week.
On saturday we were sitting in his basement on his computer when he asked if I wanted to do it now.
I was still a little nervous about doing it but I said alright and we ate about 4 buttons.
It was pretty bad tasting but not as horrible as I expected it to be.
We ate the first 4 at about 10 oclock and waited about half an hour then ate 3 more buttons.
Still nothing was happening, My stomache hurt a little bit but I didnt feel like I had to throw up.
About 15 minutes later I noticed when I closed my eyes that colorful patterns were flying around and I would see certain pictures.
Q was pretty bad at this point, but he said he was feeling very good.
I wasnt noticing anything too different, colors were alot brighter, the carpet and walls were sparkling, but thats about it.
2-5 minutes later I was sitting in the chair and all the sudden everything I looked at was moving sparkling and I felt like I was connecting with things alot better than I usually was.
My friend was talking to me and told me to go look in the mirror and that there would be something funny.
So I went in the bathroom and looked in the mirror and noticed nothing funny.
I asked him 'whats so funny' and he said 'look at your eyes' I am so glad he pointed that out.
My pupils were probably the size of a quarter, no joke.
They were huge, It kinda scared me at first but then I realized that his were huge to so I calmed down.
I went up stairs to go get a drink of koolaid.
As I walked around the corner and walked towards his front door I noticed bubbles were floating around infront of the door and it kind of scared me, I wondered if someone was in the house blowing bubbles, which seemed alot scarier at the time than when I think about it now.
I asked Q to come upstairs and look and he said there were no bubbles and to calm down, so I went in the kitchen got a drink and went back downstairs.
It was semi hard to walk, not really if I didnt think about it, but if I thought it was hard to walk all the sudden I would forget how and just sit down and crawl.
Walking felt really heavy like I had something really heavy on my feet.
I went to the couch and sat down and asked him to put The Doors record on.
So he got up and looked at me and said 'WHAT!
' I looked back at him and repeated myself.
Then he just went over and put it on.. Hmm.
Now it was about 2 hours after we had eaten it and still everything was very different.
We were listening to Led Zeppelin IV now and staring up at the ceiling.
As I sat there I felt like I understood things that I had never understood before.
Things were so clear now, like I knew everything.
My friend said he was feeling kind of sick so he went in the bathroom.
He seemed to be gone for about 2 hours, I had forgoten all about him and was sitting on the couch with my eyes closed seeing wonderful pictures and designs.
Finally I realized that Q was still in the bathroom so I got up and knocked on the door.
That was a task.
I had absolutely no strenghth at all.
Moving my arms back and forth to knock seemed like it took forever to do.
He said come in and I walked in and he was just sitting on the floor looking into the mirror and whispering to himself.
He said he was okay though, he said he just threw up a little then sat down because looking at himself was interesting.
I asked him how come he was in there so long and he said hed only been in there for about 5-10 minutes.
I disagreed and said hed been gone for a very long time.
He asked how long I thought and I told him about 2-3 hours.
He asked my why the music was still playing and then I realized he was right.
We ended up going to bed around 5 in the morning, the peyote was almost gone now, light was brighter still but no more pictures or hallucinations.
In the morning Q woke up first and woke me up.
He said he was hungry so we went upstairs and had a bowl of cereal.
While eating we talked about the things that happened that night.
Both of us thought we had a better feel for our lives now, almost like we could feel all our feelings inside better, and how we felt so relaxed.
Anyway I did peyote 4 days ago, and had another good trip.

For those of you out there who know of Jim Morrison and the Doors, and the magic they wove into their electrifying rock-poetry, perhaps some of you know of Jim's Peyote trip in the Deserts outside California...
Seeing as how I have always been interested in Jim's life, and wondering how he lived and why he did the things he did...I decided what better way than to try to see what can be seen on the powers of Mescaline in its purest form: PEYOTE cactus.
So to make the long story short, i made some phone calls and obtained some peyote a few weeks later.
So one night in my room, I decided to ingest the peyote, and yes it tastes foul.
After about two hours, i could clearly start seeing objects starting to change vividly in shape and color.
Now with LSD, usually the things you see are formed out of objects in your line of vision...with Peyote you see things, spirits, animals... everything the universe has to show us.
I wandered outside, and began to walk the dark streets of my neighborhood.
I could see in black and white, the forms of spirits who once lived on the land where I call home now.
They were so clear and real, and they knew I was there.
Somwe of these people looked as if they were startled that a living being was in their world, yet others seemed to understand that I just wanted to heal my mind, and learn whatever I could.
At some point in my trip, I heard what sounded like the wind calling me...
I turned around--directly into the face of an indian brave, feathers in hair and everything.
His lips moved, and so faintly I could hear the words...'look to la Luna..'  'look to la Luna'

'LOOK TO THE MOON'  I realized that is what he was trying to tell me.
I looked around for the moon, only to see three moons in the sky, 1 blue 1 yellow, and 1 red as blood.
As i glanced at each moon, i felt a different sensation wash over me.
Blue:  calm, sereneity, and the sound of water washing up on sandbeds....Yellow: fear of the unknown, and what is to come in my future....  RED:  was the most disturbing.
As I looked to the Red moon, my vision suddenly just flew me into the moon, wghere I could see only red flame and hear unsettling sound from beyond my line of vision...
I suddenly felt the need to close my eyes, and when I did so, I saw a scenerio of myself struggling in water, seemingly like I was drowning?
As soon as I saw this, i was transorted back to the 'world' where there was now only one moon, and the feeling of many things around me at all times, even though I could no longer see them.
For hours I contemplated life, until the trip began to make me nauseous.
I vomited after about 12 hours into the trip.
By now, back in my house, i was still seeing wonderful colors, and feeling like something was watching me...
I felt the need to sleep.
And sleep i did after about two more intense hours.
I have to say that after I woke up the next night, I felt so refreshed, like all my baggage had been lifted, and i also felt somehow like something serious was about to happen.
I am still waiting for a big event, that I know will happen, but Peyote did not reveal the time or place...so I will patiently wait, or perhaps, the secret will be revealed on my next journey to 'la Luna.

I went with some friends from a New Age bookstore to go a native Indian sweat lodge.
We were there all weekend.
My wife was invited to go, but at the last minute changed her mind.
I dont think she would have liked it much any ways; it was a lot of roughing it, campfires, rain, hard ground and an odd assortment of food.
But then again, it is an attempt to get back to native ways, so it was very appropriate.
We arrived at 7pm and did a sweat, then ate some food, to get ready for the Medicine tent at midnight.
At that point we spent the whole night in a full size teepee, with the fire going in the inside, and it raining on the outside.
Of course there was very little sleeping since it was a ceremony with prayers, singing and so on, we werent encouraged to sleep (they would poke at you if you started to dose off or get too comfortable.
Think of it as a self-imposed endurance test.
The most provocative part of course was the Medicine Tent, the teepee.
We didnt know what medicine was, thinking maybe that we might smoke some grass or some thing like that.
I myself have only smoked it on occasion and had never taken any psychedelic drugs of any kind.
However, it was much more of an endurance test than that.
They gave us three types of Peyote, one in a dry granola form, one in a wet gritty and spongy form and then as a tea.
As soon as I had choked down the one bite, they would pass the bowls around again.
This happened 5 times.
It was awful.
It tasted like gritty wet cow pie, and was insanely bitter.
To get well or throw up, was expected as part of the treatment.
I am not one to throw up so I endured it only to have it effect me for the next few days as it would work its way out of my system, I could hardly keep any food in me I had such diarrhea.
We were told we all had a significant amount of it, and that the effects in the medicine tent were going to be different than if we took it on the outside.
However it also stands to reason that no one in his or her right mind would endure this as a recreational drug.
It was too horrible.
I am not sure what others experienced during their vision questing, but I was beginning to see some visions, even though we were told this was not a hallucinogenic, but rather for clearing and focusing the mind.
Predominantly I saw the fire's timbers pulsating, and the embers took on the shape of spines and bones, skulls and faces.
The face of the old man sitting on the far side of the teepee was clear to me with his long beard and sharp nose and features.I looked up from the fire, and it was him to the detail, he was already looking at me from across the fire with his steel blue eyes.
I felt I knew him from some were, even a past life.
He looked like the wizard.
Other images came to mind later.I couldnt imagine any one meditating from all the boisterous singing, the sharp stabbing pain in our backs as we lay on the hard floor and of course the waves of nausea that flooded over with each dose of the cactus.
Many of the experienced practitioners made a hasty retreat for the door as they felt the bitter drug coming back up their throats.
But even then I look back and recall all the fears that were welling up in me, that feeling of the native wanting to claw its way out, contrasted by the scared white man that wanted to run away from this crude uncivilized world I was experiencing.
I could see my fears in front of me, and they seemed to take shape, they were real and tangible, and floated in front of me like shapes.
I listened to the voices in the teepee around me and they were unfamiliar, Spanish, Lakota, and even French.
They all seemed to speak above me, and leave me out, paranoia set in about what they might be saying, maybe about me.
I could see what looked like many lifetimes as a white man, and his western mind obsessed with comfort, cleanliness, and desire to be a separate ego and pride as an individual.
This feeling of community and back to nature was now alarming me with fear.
Fears of nature, panic of the lack of comforts, like electricity, and warm sugary and processed food.
The feeling was irrational if it was just from my surroundings, but I felt this feeling of not being at one with the savages, and the lack of understanding and conflict the western mind has with nature and that which he cannot control came from many life times.
Not just my past lifetimes, but the lifetimes of my white ancestry, it was in my blood and DNA, breed into me, by my great, great, grandparents who also knew of this white fear.
Why is it when the lights blink out for an hour it is the topic of conversation or the traffic light on the corner is outwhite fear.
What about the grocery not having a certain item we want or gas prices rising, forcing us to consider alternatives to our comfortswhite fear.
Of those that are different skin than us, those that speak of foreign tongues, they could take overwhite fear.
What of those that worship in nature, a female mother goddess, frightening nakedness, and a religion that talks of becoming one with the earthwhite fear.
The music, that I knew on the outside I had identified with and longed for, was now beating harshly on my ears, the earth I wanted to bond with was now ground into my every pore, the sense of oneness with others was forced on me as we huddled sweaty and naked together in darkness.
I had so often longed to get away from the faults and obsessions that Americans embrace.
I dont understand or appreciate most of popular culture and its escapist fantasies.
But now, here in my new tribal world I felt like a stranger, and I shuddered and panicked at the experience of not having the comforts that I was so accustomed to.
The following breakfast ceremony was equally brutal to my stimulus.
Cold corn and cold buffalo meat didnt appeal to my stomach that now turned inside out.
Then it was dawn, and I was exhausted.
They allowed us to collapse momentarily, and even as bodies walked around and over me, I could hear them in the distance talking, but I ignored it all.
I couldnt tell the drugs effects from sleep depravation.
Then about as the sun was rising, and the rain was breaking up, we huddled to the outside fire again and waited.
The second sweat, they promised would be very meaningful and empowering.
I crawled in to the hut, on the cold and wet dirt floor; my sense of smell could no longer detect sweat or the pungent smoke that permeated everything.
The girls were on one side and the men on the other.
They held peace pipe, and as the stones were brought in by the fire bearers one by one, they touched the tip of the pipestone bowls to the red hot rock grandmothers, 28 stones in all.
Then they lit the pipes, and as they were stoked I marveled at the ceremony, as each one silently gave reverence to the 4 quarters, their pipe, the sky and earth, and spun them around to the next person.
It was quite beautiful how synchronized it became.
Soon, one by one the large pipes let out their last breath of smoke and the door was closed to the wig wham.
This time it was different.
I couldnt see the light and it felt like night had descended again.
When the singing and ceremonies began the steam rolled off the hot rocks and I could feel my face burning.
I looked up and saw faces again, this time in the faint outlines of light that snuck into the walls.
The faces were of ancestors, but also of death.
The grim reapers face formed, as if again saying I am the great white death that all your people have faced. Another face emerged and it was in a war paint, streaming down vertically on a painted white face.
I believe it was a Crow tribe, and their war paint.
Both loomed in eminent death.
The smaller face of the native death, held more strange fear and anger than the familiar and stereotypical face of the Reaper.
They both seemed to wink at me and I could almost hear them say, be good kid with a laugh.
I knew they were goading me and teasing.
I responded in my mind, there is no good or bad me, just me!
To which they seemed to knowingly nod, approvingly.
At least they would not take me with out me having first learned this lesson in life.
When I finally thought I had faced all my demons and fears, the door flew open one last time, and the babe that the parents wanted to bring in was handed in wrapped naked in a fresh towel to the mother.
We closed in what was called a baby sweat, and I awaited one last final and mild steam to come over me.
It turned out to be the straw that broke my will.
The child was brave, and I thought to my self, it is us that fear the womb, not the child who probably hated to have recently left it only months ago.
Finally the heat and the water, splashing on him gave him to raise his cry in discomfort.
All of our parental meters went into overdrive, and the women as much as the men were shifting uncomfortably, as our primal instincts told us we must tend to this pain, and save the baby.
Some even spoke out in ceremony not able to hold their tongues any longer.
I myself started counting the minutes, that we might have to endure it, and then there was silence.
This silence proved to increase the primal tension.
Was the baby ok?
Did it pass out, how could it suddenly be so still, how would we know in this darkness that the child was still all right?
The seconds ticked by even longer as the priest poured out more song, and more water for steam.
Finally we were released from this hell, and the baby cried once again as the door flap was ordered open.
It didnt come right away, and we were again forced to wait against everyones will this time.
Did they forget about us, did they all go back to the house because of the rain?
No, finally some one took mercy on us, and the door flew back.
Some of us stayed collapsed as the heat rolled out and the cool fresh air poured in.
I crawled out around some of the bodies and around the circle of steaming stones.
I literally kissed the earth and staggered to me feet.
I saw S and she was the one to have stayed behind for us.
I kidded her saying she was our Valkyrie come to retake our souls from their voyage.
We gathered around the fire, and I stood the longest in the rain with only my towel around me, so disoriented, and not being able to gage my own body temperature.
I slipped and fell, cutting my hand as I struggled to put on my robe.
The grey haired old professor, was now back after having found his missing friend who had been wandering the woods and the highway after the medicine lodge.
She spoke only French and the group had been very concerned for her.
Now, relieved, it was his turn to smoke his pipe, and he invited us to do so.
We all hugged and rejoiced in our new lives.
Our native guide held out his wet trunks over the fire to dry on a stick, as if he were waving a victory flag.
Later of course, we retired to the house, were I again gave thanks for indoor plumbing, and even though I couldnt hold any food down I was thankful to purge myself of those toxins still coursing through me.
Most of us tried to eat some thing, and the dinner from the night before, that again greeted us with pies, soups, and deserts, no longer had their allure.
All I could stand was liquid and a few bites of salad and bread.
It was a good experience, and brought about a lot of introspection.

I bought this peyote powder for $20 for '2 doses'.
I wasnt really educated but I figured it was a one-time deal, so I bought it.
Waiting for a good time to do it is hard when youre young, so when we had a weekday off of school I knew it was the right time.
I gave the friend that held the peyote half for helping me out.
So this stuff was fine grain powder, a greenish color with red, brown and orange speckles.
I mixed it in with a milkshake and was off.
First drink, horrible, made me want to throw it out and just stay sober.
But I fought through and in 10 minutes, the green milkshake was gone.
So now it was time to wait the time was about 7:15.
After my friend finished his, we headed up to his brothers room to chill.
At 7:45 I vomited my guts out.
But then I felt better.
This is when the trip began.
My friends brother had this mushroom poster and it was tripping me to death.
Peyote doesnt really make me out of control or dumber, but more or less simply different.
I was looking a everything different.
Well then I took a few hits off a bong and went into a dream world.
It was really fun, listening to the doors and chilling, looking at colors and patterns were the funnest.
Peyote was a great experience but it wasnt what I predicted, I thought I was going to be in a dream world, with floating colors and magic, but I was just seeing very little and felt like it was impossible to move.
My body tingled the whole time.

A best friend of mine is full native american.
His mother was an experienced shaman and used peyote as part of her religion to induce visions that had value to her dogma.
For years, me and her son had tried to persuade her to let us try her sacred drink but she would always modestly turn us down.
Telling her son that he was not mentally mature enough to handle it and telling me that I was white and would not understand nor enjoy the experience.
One day when we were both 18, my best friend and I decided to spent part of the evening toking some homegrown northern lights he had been growing.
The normal and familiar intoxication followed.
We continuously laughed and made jokes over issues.
This followed some weight lifting, video games(tony hawk), sparring (were both skilled in martial arts), and an evening walk.
Later we returned home to finish the stash and probably go out and hit up the strip.
We packed the bong and took several tokes before his door swung open.
CAUGHT!
His mother, the only parent living with him, came in and sat across from him.
He had moved the bong behind him and was hiding the remains of the weed in his closed fist.
'What's are you hiding?
' his mother asked, raising an eyebrow.
It was obvious at this point we were both incredibly stoned.
Her eyes darted at me, and back at him.
As always while under the influence of marijuana, I am able to perceive body language much better.
'Jonathan, let me see it, I'm going to smoke some too.
' she spoke.
Me and Jonathan looked at each other and burst into uncontrolled laughter.
'No way mom!
' 

'OK, but you have to let me and Tim in on that tea.
' Her eyes spaced out for a second, her face completely calm and confident, giving nothing away.
Then she nodded.
'Fair enough.
'

Jonathan reveals to her the large bong hidden behind him, already packed.
She takes a very large toke and clears the whole bullpiece and stares ahead, her face expressionless, then she blows the whole cloud of smoke out without coughing.
Needless to say, me and Jon were impressed.
She then disappeared into her room, locked her door, and emerged about 1/2 hour later with 2 large wooden cups with colorful designs.
She beckoned us into the living room.
We sat, candles lit across the dim room.
She raised the cup to her mouth and breathed into it, but in a controlled burst, making hissing noises into the fluid.
She then spoke in her native language as if blessing the drink and handed one to me.
Doing the same with the next, and handing it to Jonathan.
We both gulped the disgusting tasting fluid down quickly, almost gagging.
She took our cups and stood.
'You must be left in solitude to fully learn the plant.
' With this, she retires to her room.
We sat there, waiting for something to happen, not sure what to think.
Somewhere along the way I have fallen asleep.
I have no dreams, only inky blackness, and deep, undisturbed sleep.
I wake in cold sweat.
Jonathan has just gotten up and ran to the bathroom.
He's very loud at this point, yelling out profanity.
I'm still in the haze of my sleep, not really catching all he's saying.
I look at the clock, and we've been asleep for about 2 hours.
The candles across the room seem to dance and sway, but I'm not paying attention, I jump to my feet and follow Jonathan down the hall.
I can hear him in his bathroom, vomiting.
Before I can even make it to the bathroom, something has hit me.
I look at the door at the end of the hall.
It burst wildly out of control and spins to the left to the right, almost like its a top, but never fully completing a 180 degree turn.
It seems like its charging toward me, swaying back and forth.
My heart skips a beat and I instinctively raise my hands in a classic Karate stance as if to fight it off.
I can see my fist in front of me, and yet they looked so foreign.
My hands seem to expand and swell, as if made of some type of liquid.
Then they dissolve and melt into bright colors, hues of blue and green, mostly blue.
'What is it?
' I say out loud.
'I can't...
I can't... it's too much.
' I manage to gasp out.
I immediately felt like I had gone in way too over my head.
I felt like I felt the sense of deja-vu when I had once been talked into riding the scariest roller coaster at Busch Gardens, and once I was on it, I became so frightened, that I wanted it to end.
This was exactly how I felt right now and things got worse.
I could still hear Jonathan in the bathroom, mumbling and rambling random words.
I knew he was in the same world I was.
Yet I felt a million miles away from him, stuck in my own dilemma, fighting my own demons.
I turned and made my way to the door and lay in the center of the floor.
The light fixture overhead turned into a large, insectoid looking structure before my eyes that hovered over me.
I was terrified.
'No...
no!
' I screamed.
The creature then seemed to speak to me, breaking away into a jewel like structure, moving in a clockwise-wise pattern.
Each wave making weird noise I can't describe in words.
I curled myself into a ball and buried my face deep within the fibers of the carpet, only to be immersed in the world of the most insane closed eyed visuals I'd ever seen.
I've done extremely high doses of shrooms, eating a 1/2 oz before, 800 mgs of dxm, as well as several salvia experiences, and yet nothing was like this.
It was out of this world.
I was traveling down a blue lit path, through space.
I was being sucked into a black hole.
Slowly as I grew closer to the black ominous object, the figures of Orion swirled and waved around it.
I was getting closer.
As I got closer, everything split into two, separated by the intense gravitational pull.
I was flung at light speed through the event horizon, where all the light circled in a cone shape, unable to escape the pull.
I was spinning, very quickly, faster than I could imagine, in a world of lights and colors.
Into the singularity, into the singularity, which was a the realm of the unknown.
I opened my eyes and ran out the front door, and puked in the front lawn.
I immediately felt better.
It was quiet, and for a second or two, the visions stopped.
Then they started up again, gentler, milder this time, and more euphoric.
The blades of the grass rose and circled around me, moving, very much alive.
Bright yellows flowers from her garden, slowly hued over to blue and extended their petals, creating snakes flowing from the center of the flower, which became a flux of geometrical creation.
It was no longer frightening, it was beautiful, completely beautiful.
The geometry became vines, tongues, and swirls of rainbow colors.
'WOW' I managed.
I turned my head, to view the whole quiet suburban street and everything was swept away by light and colors.
I looked up at the sky, and the stars shone down, only to travel to the center and create an orb in the sky that I perceived as god.
The orb separated into halos of geometry, that extended further and further away in waves until they made up the whole sky.
All moving in a beautiful sea of religous geometrical shapes.
First making the star of david, then a cross, and expanding away into snakes.
The snakes were all around me now.
One curled around my body and eyeballed me for a few seconds with non hostile eyes, it then curled and spun away, my eyes following it, watching it absorb the whole world into a flash of brilliant colors.
I cant remember how long I stood outside, remarked by nature.
It must have been hours, just standing in one spot, blown away by the visions and the animality and signifigance of each.
I had returned into the house to find Jonathan sitting on his bed, his mother sitting next to him.
I was still hallucinating heavily at this point, and my body still felt heavy, yet undefinably free.
I felt like I was expanding and becoming part of my vision, its totally hard to describe in words.
Jonathan was talking of his visions.
I looked at the clock, yet could not see the letters, whenever I almost got a good glance at the lettering, they dissolved into particles and were lost in the fabric of time.
'The time...?
' I spoke out loud.
'3:30, your experience is almost over.
'

Slowly the visions became more and more subtle, consisting of only changes and colors of Jonathan's face.
His mother had left the room, and we talked of our visions.
I told him of the beautiful snakes and colors I had seen outside.
He said he saw skeletons.
He said he saw his own body as a skeleton with no flesh.
He talked of horrifying visions of hell of insects crawling across his floor, the scariest being a scorpion with a large stinger.
We spent the whole remaining of the late night talking of our visions and our enlightenment from each till morning.
To this day, I still have a strong belief that peyote is a gateway into an invisible world, that is unseen and not understood by the naked eye and the sober mind.
Everything around us, a rock, a blade of grass, contains a spirit, and a consciousness.
Since then, I have an undeniable newfound respect for life of plants and animals.
I long to repeat the experience again.

[Erowid Note:  The following report was published in The British Medical Journal in 1896.
The author, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, was a well-respected American Physician who  became the first president of the Congress of American Physicians and Surgeons.
This report was accompanied by a report by his colleague Dr. Eshner describing his experience with a similar extract.
]

At 12 noon of a busy morning I took fully 1½ drachm of an extract of which each drachm represented one mescal button.
I had in a half-hour a sense of great gastric discomfort, and later of distension.
At 1 p.m.
I took a little over a drachm.
Between 2 and 3 p.m.
I noted my face was flushed; the pupils were dilated midway, the pulse 80 and strong.
I had a light sense of exhilaration, a tendency to talk, and now and then I misplaced a word.
The knee-jerk and station were normal.
Between 2 and 4 oclock I had outside of my house two consultations, and saw several patients.
I observed that with a pleasing sense of languor there was an unusual amount of physical endurance.
I went rather quietly, taking two stairs at a time and without pause, to the fourth storey of an hotel, and did not feel oppressed or short of breath.
This is akin to the experience, as I learn, of the mescal-eating Indians, and to that of many white men.
Meanwhile my stomach was more uncomfortable, and I saw the first evidence of any change in my colour records.
On closing my eyes (while in my carriage), I held longer than usual any bright object just seen.
As to this, however, I am not as sure as I am concerning the later phenomena.
About 4:10 p.m.
I drove home, and after taking half an ounce of extract [0.5 oz = 4 drachms] in three doses I lay on a lounge and read, becoming steadily more conscious, at first of a left frontal pain (not severe) and soon after of a dull occipital ache felt on both sides and at or about the occipital bosses.
Yawning at times, sleepy, deliciously at languid ease, I was clearly in the land where it is always afternoon. At 4:30 p.m., rising to make notes, I became aware that a transparent, violet haze was about my pen point, a tint so delicate as at times to seem doubtfully existent.
At this stage of the mescal intoxication I had a certain sense of the things about me as having a more positive existence than usual.
It is not easy to define what I mean, and at the time I searched my vocabulary for phrase or word which should fitly state my feeling.
It was in vain.
At this time, also, I had a decisive impression that I was more competent in mind than in my everyday moods.
I seemed to be sure of victoriously dealing with problems.
This state of mind may be easily matched in the condition of some men when pretty far gone in alcohol intoxication.
My own mood was gently flatteringa mere consciousness of power, with meanwhile absolute control of every faculty.
I wrote a long letter of advice dealing with a rather doubtful diagnosis, and on reading it over was able to see that it was neither better nor worse than my average letter.
Yet the sense of increased ability was so notable that, liking to test it, and with common-sense disbelief in its flattery, I took up a certain paper on psychology, which a week before I had laid down in despair.
I grieve to say that it was less to be comprehended than ever.
My ignorance would have remained bliss had I not made the experiment.
I next tried to do a complicated sum, but soon discovered that my ordinary inefficiency as to figures was not really increased.
A mood is like a climate and cannot be reasoned with.
I continued to have for some two hours this elated sense of superiority.
I was for this while in that condition in which some people permanently abide.
The further test of writing a few lines of verse was tried.
I found there was much effort needed.
I lay down again about 5:20, fort observing that the outer space field seemed to be smoky.
Just at this time, my eyes being closed, I began to see tiny points of light, like stars or fire flies, which came and went in a moment.
My palms were now tingling, my face a little flushed.
About 5:40 the star points became many, and then I began to observe something like fragments of stained glass windows.
The glass was not very brilliant, but the setting, which was irregular in form, seemed to be made of incessantly flowing sparkles of pale silver now going here, now there, to and fro, like, as I thought, the inexplicable rush and stay and reflux of the circulation seen through a lens.
These window patterns were like fragments coming into view and fading.
Hoping for still better things in the way of colour, I went upstairs lay down in a darkened room and waited.
In a few minutes the silver stars were seen again, and later I found that these always preceded any other more remarkable visions.
The display which for an enchanted two hours followed was such as I find it hopeless to describe in language which shall convey to others the beauty and splendour of what I saw.
I shall limit myself to a statement of a certain number of the more definite visions thus projected on the screen of consciousness.
During these two hours I was generally wide awake.
I was comfortable, save as to certain gastric conditions, which were not so severe as to distract attention.
Time passed with little sense for me of its passage.
I was critically attentive, watchful, interested, and curious, making all the time mental notes for future use.
Especially at the close of my experience I must, I think, have been for a while in the peculiar interval between the waking state and that of sleepthe praedormitumthe time when we are apt to dream half- half controlled stories; but as to this I am not very sure.
As a rule, I was on guard with every power of observation and reflection in full activity.
My first vivid show of mescal colour effects came quickly.
I saw the stars, and then, of a sudden, here and there delicate floating films of colourusually delightful neutral purples and pinks.
These came and wentnow here, now there.
Then an abrupt rush of countless points of white light swept across the field of view, as if the unseen millions of the Milky Way were to flow a sparkling river before the eye.
In a minute this was over and the field was dark.
Then I began to see zigzag lines of very bright colours, like those seen in some megrims.
I tried to fix the place and relation of these tints, but the changes were such as to baffle me.
One was an arch of angled lines of red and green, but of what else I could not determine.
It was in rapid, what I may call minute, motion.
The tints of intense green and red shifted and altered, and soon were seen no more.
Here, again, was the wonderful loveliness of swelling clouds of more vivid colours gone before.
I could name them, and, sometimes rising from the lower field, and very swiftly altering in colour tones from pale purples and rose to greys, with now and then a bar of level green or orange intense as lightning and as momentary.
When I opened my eyes all was gone at once.
Closing them I began after a long interval to see for the first time definite objects associated with colours.
The stars sparkled, and passed away.
A white spear of grey stone grew up to huge height, and became a tall, richly finished Gothic tower of very elaborate and definite design, with many rather worn statues standing in the doorways or on stone brackets.
As I gazed every projecting angle, cornice, and even the face of the stones at their joinings were by degrees covered or hung with clusters of what seemed to be huge precious stones, but uncut, some being more like masses of transparent fruit.
These were green, purple, red, and orange; never clear yellow and never blue.
All seemed to possess an interior light, and, to give the faintest idea of the perfectly satisfying intensity and purity of these gorgeous colour-fruits is quite beyond my power.
All the colours I have ever beheld are dull as compared to these.
As I looked, and it lasted long, the tower became of a fine mouse hue, everywhere the vast pendant masses of emerald green, ruby reds, and orange began to drip a slow rain of colours.
All this while nothing was at rest a moment.
The balls of colour moved tremulously.
The tints became dull, and then, at once, past belief vivid; the architectural lines were all active with shifting tints.
The figures moving shook the long hanging lines of living light, and then, in an instant, all was dark.
After an endless display of less beautiful marvels I saw that which deeply impressed me.
An edge of a huge clif seem [sic] to project over a gulf of unseen depth.
My viewless enchanter set on the brink a huge bird claw of stone.
Above, from the stem or leg, hung a fragment of some stuff.
This began to unroll and float out to a distance which seemed to me to represent Time as well as immensity of Space.
Here were miles of rippled purples, half transparent, and of ineffable beauty.
Now and then soft golden clouds floated from these folds, or a great shimmer went over the whole of the rolling purples, and things, like green birds, fell from it, fluttering down into the gulf below.
Next, I saw clusters of stones hanging in masses from the claw toes, as it seemed to me miles of them, down far below into the underworld of the black gulf.
This was the most distinct of my visions.
Incautiously I opened my eyes and it was gone.
A little later I saw interlaced and numberless hoops in the air all spinning swiftly and all loaded with threaded jewels or with masses of colour in long ropes of clustered balls.
I began to wonder why I saw no opals, and some minutes after each of these circles, which looked like a boys hoop, became huge opals; if I should say fluid opals it would best describe what was however like nothing earthly.
I set myself later to seeing if I could conjure figures, for so far I had seen nothing human in form, nor any which seemed alive.
I had no luck at this, but a long while after I saw what seemed a shop with apothecaries bottles, but of such splendour [of?
] green, red, purple, as are not outside of the pharmacies of fairy land.
On the left wall was pinned by the tail a brown worm of perhaps a hundred feet long.
It was slowing rotating, like a catherine wheel [pinwheel], nor did it seem loathly.
As it turned, long green and red tentacles fell this way and that.
On a bench near by two little dwarfs, made, it seemed, of leather, were blowing through long glass pipes of green tint, which seemed to me to be alive, so intensely, vitally green were they.
But it were vain to find in words what will describe these colours.
Either they seemed strangely solid, or to possess vitality.
They still linger visibly in my memory, and left the feeling that I had seen among them colours unknown to my experience.
Their variety and strange juxtapositions were indeed fascinating for one to whom colour is more than it is to most men; nor is it possible to describe the hundredth of what I saw saw.
I was at last conscious of the fact that at moments I was almost asleep, and then wide awake.
In one of these magic moments I saw my last vision and the strangest.
I heard what appeared to be approaching rhythmical sounds, and then saw a beach, which, I knew to be that of Newport.
On this, with a great noise, which lasted but a moment, rolled in out of darkness wave on wave.
These as they came, were liquid splendours huge and threatening, of wonderfully pure green, or red or deep purple, once only deep orange and with no trace of foam.
These water hills of colour broke on the bench with myriads of lights of the same tint as the wave.
This lasted some time, and while, it did so I got back to more distinct consciousness, and wished the beautiful terror of these huge mounds of colour would continue.
A knock at my door caused me to open my eyes, and I lost whatever of wonder might have come after.
After dinner I ceased to be able to see any further display of interest.
Now and then a purple or pink fragment appeared, but that was all.
For a day after I noted the fact that my visions could be easily recalled by a memorial effort, but with less and less sharpness.
These shows are expensive.
For two days I had headache and for one day a smart attack of gastric distress.
This came after the first dose, and was most uncomfortable.
The experience, however, was worth one such headache and indigestion, but was not worth a second.
Dr. Prentiss and others describe mescal as causing insomnia.
My first experience with the tincture was made early in the morning.
I became deeply flushed by noon, but had no visions.
I felt drowsy and slept very well the following night.
The extract used, as stated, did make me sleepless up to 4 a.m., but neither restless nor uneasy.
.
.
.
For the psychologist this agent should have value.
To be able with a whole mind to experiment mentally upon such phenomena as I have described is an unusual privilege.
Here is unlocked a storehouse of glorified memorial treasures of one kind.
There may be a drug which shall so release a mob of verbal memories, or of musical records, or, in fact, of tastes and odours.
I naturally speak of things seen under mescal influence as glorified memoriescertainly nothing soon in these visions was altogether outside of my known experiencesbut everything was expressiveforms were giganticcolours marvellously intermingled.
In fact, nothing was simply the vision of a thing remembered and recognised except the familiar Newport Beach.
I see no obvious therapeutic uses for mescal in massive doses.
It is yet to be tested by continuous employment in moderate amounts, and may be of value.
I sought so to limit the influence of mescal as to remain in full possession of all my faculties.
The larger doses secure, as Dr. Prentiss has shown, more remarkable results, but may lessen the power to observe and to comment.
I should dread a little lest excessive amounts might leave too permanent effects.
In fact, I constantly carried for days a quite vivid image of one of these jewel clusters, seeing it mentally whenever my mind was turned upon the subject of my visions.
I predict a perilous reign of the mescal habit when this agent becomes attainable.
The temptation to call again the enchanting magic of my experience will, I am sure, be too much for some men to resist after they have once set foot in this land of fairy colours where there seems to be so much to charm and so little to excite horror or disgust.
Were I to take mescal again I should dictate to a stenographer all that I saw and in due order.
No one can hope to remember for later record so wild a sequence of colour and of forms.
But since to talk does not disturb these visions, a perfect account might easily be given.
No one has told us what visions come to the Red man.
I should like to know if those of the navy [laborer] would be like those of the artist, and above all, what those born blind could relate; and, too, such as are born colour blind.

[Erowid Note:  The following report was published in The British Medical Journal in 1896.
The author, Dr. Eshner, was on the staff of Washington's Infirmary for Nervous Disease.
Eshner describes what experienced when he took a total of 3.66 fluid drachms of an extract of peyote (equal to about 3.66 peyote buttons) on Memorial Day of 1896.
Dan Perrine has described this experience as the First 'Bicycle-Day' in reference to Albert Hofmann's first experience with LSD in 1943.
This report accompanied an even longer report by S. Weir Mitchell describing his experience with a similar extract.
]


I found I could not keep at serious work; I felt some distraction, and lacked my usual mental concentration.
I soon began to feel badly, lapsing into a condition of general malaise, with not a little prostration, and had to give up any attempt at work, however small.
I found some comfort in lying down, and when my eyes closed I became conscious of a series of visual impressions, in most of which colour sensations were present.
The pictures were characteristically kaleidoscopic, particularly as regards uniformity of arrangement.
They changed frequently at times, like lantern pictures on a screen.
The designs were Various; some were Oriental, with stars and crescents, and points of light interspersed; others were mosaic in arrangement; some were screen-like; some, fern-like; some showed chased figures.
Neither the images nor the light were very vivid, although as a rule quite distinct.
The intensity at times appeared related to the vigour with which the eyes were closed.
At about 6.30 P.M.
I arose and attempted to eat a little, but failed.
Nausea was quite pronounced, and there was total loss of appetite.
At no time did vomiting occur.
I then lay down for half or three-quarters of an hour, and the visions were repeated.
I had intended going out in the evening, and, in the hope of gaining relief, I equipped myself for a bicycle ride, and started off, despite my langour and general depression.
I made my way to the Park without the slightest difficulty, and at Girard Bridge met and spoke to an acquaintance, stopped under the bridge to view the Memorial Day illumination, and went on.
I rode in all about eight miles, going down a fairly steep declivity with ease, and descending a longer and perhaps steeper declivity with almost equal ease.
I perspired en route, not unduly, but perceptibly.
I felt that my pupils must be dilated from the brilliancy of the light, with prismatic radiations and the large amount that entered my eyes.
I think ocular accommodation may also have been affected, although the visual langour may have been only a part of the general langour Vision seemed not alert.
I was in a state of placid indifference, free from enthusiasm, free from aspiration, without spontaneity.
I imagine there was a little dryness of the secretions of the mouth and throat, because my voice appeared a little deeper and fuller than usual.
I was scarcely conscious of ordinary movement, and felt as though I could scarcely make any extraordinary movement, although

I was conscious of the necessity of making the effort, and of the increased exertion necessary in mounting the hill of which I have spoken.
In general, however, I seemed to go on by virtue of my own momentum.
In a figurative way, I felt as if I were of the same density as the medium in which I floated, so that I would yield to slight external physical impulses.
The feeling is one that I can best describe as muscular or motor anaesthesia.
I was a little indifferent as to how I rode, yet not careless nor without a sense of responsibility, but I made little effort to avoid the rougher places, and appreciated very little jolting.
I sustained my equilibrium perfectly, and was not compelled to dismount other than intentionally.
I rode slowly down Broad Street by the side of a four-in-hand and listened with enjoyment to the strains of the trumpeter.
I met a little messenger boy on a bicycle who made a ludicrous impression on me, and whom at his request I helped to a match without dismounting.
I reached home about half-past nine, and called at the house of Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, and in his absence left a note for him.
I was more fortunate in finding Dr. J. K. Mitchell at home, who noticed the deepening in my voice, dilatation of the pupils, some injection of the eyes, a little flushing of the face, increased knee-jerks and active muscle-jerks, a heart beat of 72, and, as he thought, some evident effort in speech.
My own feeling was one of partial release of inhibition, of relaxation of restraint and of repression.
The state was not a pleasurable, but rather a helpless one.
I could write freely and with ease about what I had passed through and was passing through, and experienced a certain freedom and fluency of expression.
I sat up and read from about ten until half-past twelve, the visions returning whenever I closed my eyes.
Now I was again able to see all sorts of new designs, fresco work, porcelain decorations, tapestry figures, intricate laces, parquetry, diagrams, various kinds of scroll work, etc.
I endeavoured to picture an American flag but only partially succeeded after I had retired, and then my flag was furled.
I saw coats of arms and shields and the like.
All colours were represented.
I looked especially for blue, as Dr. Mitchell had told me that he had seen all colours but blue, and I was successful.
At one time I saw various shadows of green, and at another especially purples, violets, lilacs, etc.
In none of the images were people or animals or other objects than designs represented.
As I read I was easily pleased.
At this time I experienced a sense of nausea, with a suggestion of burning and weight in the umbilical region; but this was gone by the following morning.
Before going to bed I partook of a sandwich and some milk.
I found the sense of taste benumbed.
I was not able to fall asleep for some time.
My sense of hearing seemed to be more receptive, but less acute.
The condition might be described as an impairment of the auditory accommodation comparable to the corresponding ocular state.
My breathing failed specially to attract my attention, but seemed shallow.
I was conscious of pain on being pinched.
The night was a restless one, with some snatches of sleep of varying length, but I arose with ease at the usual hour, feeling not much the worse for my late experiences, and not at all sleepy.
There remained a sense of fulness in the head, but no other reminder.
I partook of my usual breakfast with ordinary relish.
The preparation had a disagreeable nauseous taste, with suggestion of pungency (Mitchell, 1896).

Nestled in a secluded, high southwestern desert valley, there exists a quasi-legal, all-race peyote-using church.
I say quasi-legal because protection for growing its sacrament, peyote, is by state statute alone, not Federal law.
Officially formed in the late seventies, the church has thrived for many years fighting for all-race religious peyote use.
Based upon the tenets of the Native American Church and fused with some of the doctrines of Mormonism, the church teaches love, holiness and a respect for nature that is literally awesome to behold firsthand.
As I arrived at this seemingly barren location late one afternoon, I wondered what I would encounter in such a brutally hot desert locale.
I was not disappointed.
All I can say of the weekend experience is that it all finally made sense to me.
Greeted at the door by the original founder of the church, I was received with open arms and immediately felt the love of my hosts.
I was given a brief tour of the humble premises and was then shown the Peyote House where over 1,000 peyote cactuses were growing.
One of the apostles proudly displayed a collection of illegal sacred plants.
I asked how the church could operate such an openly illegal practice given the strict Federal laws regarding the growing and harvesting of peyote, at which she replied that their state and the surrounding community have taken great pains to protect religious freedom.
Being a predominant Mormon community, the area has had its fair share of religious disputes with the Federal government in regard to religious freedom.
For the most part though, the Federal government has turned a blind eye to the religious practice of growing peyote for religious purposes.
After settling down and setting up my tent on their land, I was awed by the beauty of nature that surrounded me.
The desert was teeming with life and a home nearby was decorated in colorful pottery, which supports the financial aspect of the church.
Leaders of the church spend hours working on the pottery and seem to pass the time peacefully in intelligent conversation.
It is solely up to these individuals to decide whether or not one is worthy, so to speak, of partaking of the holy sacrament.
Upon my arrival, I can honestly say that I did not know whether or not I truly wanted to participate in their sacrament or whether I was prepared for the experience.
This said, my first test, it seemed, was with the founder of the church.
He is a kind and gentle 25% Native American man who asked where I came from and the purpose of my visit.
We spent time in rocking chairs while he introduced me to all of the pets and the wildlife that regularly visited the window of the house.
He told stories of his military service in World War II and unselfishly imparted his words of wisdom upon me about the meaning of life, the history of his legal troubles, and his fight for all-race peyote use.
Though he is a dedicated servant to the church, I felt no pressure from him to comprehend the complexities involved in using peyote and I was unsure of what he thought of my responses to his many questions.
One thing I did know for sure, this man had religious and social convictions that were on par with any man I have ever met.
My apparent test continued through the night and into the next morning while I had pleasant conversations with other leaders of the church as they told me how they met the churchs founder and how they were able to obtain and sustain such a great quantity of peyote.
They mentioned their love and respect for their Mormon neighbors, who have paradoxically been some of the most ardent protectors of their religious freedom in the area, although Mormonism in no way advocates their use of the controlled substance.
I began a fast in the morning at the recommendation of one of the apostles and spent my time hiking and exploring the wonders of the desert location.
I love the mountains and hike quite often, but nothing could prepare me for what would happen that night.
I assume I passed their test of sincerity since I was soon to be given a peyote tea.
I was honored at this gesture and listened intently as the apostles explained what to expect, if anything.
Again, I was not disappointed, for that night was the night I saw the stars dance.
The peyote sacrament was prepared in a tea, and I was also given two dried capsules of peyote to help enhance my experience with the medicine. I signed some legal papers reporting that my use of the substance was for purely religious purposes and off to the desert I was sent for what is called The Spirit Walk. Unlike the structure and ritual of the NAC peyote ceremony, The Spirit Walk is a solitary journey that the churchs founder reminded me was the key to finding out the answers to difficult questions.
The leaders disdain for the rigidity and structure of organized religions was painfully transparent, and for the first time, soon before I began my walk, I think he actually preached as a Christian zealot that he believed this was the only way one could come to understand what The Peyote Way, what life in general, was all about.
I retired to my tent slowing ingesting the most disgustingly bitter tea of my life.
As I relaxed on a lawn chair, literally in the middle of nowhere, I awaited the effects of the psychoactive substance in peyote, mescaline, to take effect.
Ever so slowly, my body began to feel warm and intensely uncomfortable.
A small buzz arose in my ears and it culminated in what seemed like the vomiting of the entire tea that I consumed over the space of about an hour.
I swallowed the peyote capsules given to me with a splash of water, and slowly but surely, everything finally made sense!
All the years of my research and reading began to unfold before my eyes.
The Is-ness of Huxley, the tune in of Leary, the set and setting of Smith all fell into place as I watched the moon begin to brighten with an intense array of color.
The trees and the ground below me were infused with what I can only describe as life. Their colors, though it was now well past dark, were a heightened green and brown with spots of red, blue and yellow.
As I looked up into the beautiful night sky, I noticed that my mouth had been wide open in awe for quite some time because my throat, lips and mouth were entirely parched.
I soon became consciously aware of why this was the case: I was watching the stars dance.
I understood now why Huxley had such a hard time describing his mescaline experience in words within his book Doors of Perception.
I understood why the set and setting so ardently defended by Huston Smith played such an important role in this experience.
My mind was entirely preoccupied with what I would normally to have considered trivial.
The rocks on the ground exploded with color, the stars ebbed and flowed with the music I was listening to and I began to sing as loudly as possible.
An overwhelming sense of joy and even a sense of love infused my whole body.
So I started to laugh, very loudly.
I laughed so hard I began to cry.
My tears were not tears of sadness or of pain, but of a giddy and even childish joy at all that was occurring to me.
My body seemed to melt into the lawn chair and I felt as if I was part and parcel of everything around me.
Then came Huxleys infamous heaven and hell experience.
Huxley wrote another book soon after Doors of Perception about his mescaline experiences in which he describes something similar to R. Gordon Wasson calls Ecstasy. However, as Wasson reports, ..ecstasy is not fun.
Your very soul is seized and shaken until it tingles. I was so overtaken by the visual sensations that I was experiencing I retired inside my tent for a while.
What awaited me was the hell and a sense of guilt and horror at all of the things I had taken for granted in my life.
I reflected on the words of the church founder when he said you can learn more by following the path of the fly than the words of a preacher.
I believe this simple phrase was meant to remind me that we are all somehow metaphysically connected to everything around us and no preacher can teach us the sublime nature of such a doctrine.
Although the preacher may be able to tell a person of the ontological importance of such doctrine, to actually follow the path of the fly, aided by the peyote experience, give a direct personal contact to what the preacher can only talk about.
I could not tell if I was talking to God or not, but what was happening to me felt like a direct experience of something divine.
Though reminded of my imperfections, I was imbued with a renewed sense and desire to overcome my imperfections and to somehow make them right.
The beauty all around me was evidence enough to convince me that I had to do something different with my life and to perceive the world in a better light.
I had to change some things and become a better father, husband and person.
I finally understood why there was such an overwhelming respect for this cactus and why it leads many Native Americans (and others) to shun alcohol use and other intoxicating substances.
In everything, I saw... goodness, and I inexplicably felt I was part of that goodness.
By this time I had lost all sense of time and sleep escaped me.
I returned outside (admittedly a little disoriented) to see my dancing stars and started a small fire, which is recommended by the clergy of the church if conditions are favorable.
I gleefully watched for what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes as the smoke and fire dwindled into the most beautiful embers of fading light.
I noticed that the mescaline was finally starting to wear off because my stars began to be fixed in their places, and I succumbed to my fatigue and fell into a blissful rest.
So what does this story have to do with harm?
Well, nobody was harmed by the use of peyote except for my family who had to endure my being gone on a three day long trip to the desert.
The right set and setting aided me in finding out some crucial information about an illegal substance revered by many a portion of the divine substance. The fact that I felt a part of that divine presence evoked a pleasure that I shared with my host the next morning.
As I broke my fast that morning with oranges, grapes and nectarines, I savored the sweetness of each bite.
In contrast to the bitter peyote, I found that even a piece of gum was immensely tasteful.
I conversed with the church founder about my experience and he again showed no signs of pushing the importance of the religious use of peyote.
His only concern was that I learned from the personal, solitary experience and that I let no other interpret what I had felt and seen.
In regard to that last sentence, I honestly do not know how to interpret what I felt and saw.
I admit that years of research did make a lot of sense to me after ingesting peyote, but I am still at a loss to describe what happened to me.
The naturalist/physicalist in me wants to explain away the experience by an appeal to the scientific evidence of how mescaline affects brain function.
My religious leanings point to a holy and sacred experience that I share with the reader in story form, hopefully with reverence.
I do not know if I will ever take a hallucinogenic substance ever again.
It is not that I am presumptuous enough to claim I have learned or experienced all there is to know about these experiences, but quoting Alan Watts, When you get the message, hang up the phone.  For now I have received enough of the message concerning the religious and recreational use of hallucinogens.
I respect the fact that others consider these substances sacred and holy or even just pleasurable and I share my peyote experience only to show that their religious use can and ought to be protected.
Although I am just as honest in defending that given the right set and setting, the hallucinogens recreational use seems to be as benign and harmless as their religious use.
Hallucinogenic substances do appear to be a boon that with the right kinds of controls and education could be used to benefit many a person.
I just hope that my story helps relay the importance of more protection for our beloved nations liberties in regard to hallucinogenic drug use.

This all started around March or so that I obtained some peyote.
I tryed it out thinking it would be some fantastic trip with just hallucinations and goofy hippy shit like that, but no, I was unaware of the power peyote can have on me.
I had absolutly no knowledge about drugs, hell I haven't even smoked weed prior to the time I did this!
No shit.
My friend was supposed to try this with me but his dumbass went to sleep!
He came over for a visit and took 2 tablespoons and stayed up for a lil bit it wasn't effecting us so he just crashed, I tryed to tell him give it some time but he just went to sleep which pissed me off.
I started playing the PS2 to kill time for awhile I played a little of MGS:2 then I felt this rush of energy and I just thought 'It's coming on!
' I quit playing for awhile and just sat down for awhile got some kool-aid and when I started playing the game again it sounded very different.
All the electronic beeping sounds, sounding slowed down, kinda like down an octave like a flat note.
I paused the game and wondered if the stereo was on the fritz then I reseted it.
It sounded really really scary!
I just turned it off and my parents told me to go to bed because I promised to go to church the next morning.
I tried going to sleep but I just couldn't sleep, I didn't feel wierd or high or anything.
My thoughts had more meaning to them.
I was lying there still awake, and I started to get nauseated and real dizzy.
I went to the bathroom to puke.
I puked hard!
My brother came out of his room and asked if I was ok, I told him I was just sick, and he asked me if I wanted the trashcan by my bed and I said yes.
Talking to him was very comforting.
Talking to anyone would've been comforting.
I told him to stay and talk longer I told him I had god awful nightmares and he did stay for a few minutes.
My dad woke up and asked if I was ok.
I said I just felt a little ill.
He just told me to drink some water and I did, I felt a world better.
They went back to sleep for awhile.
I just layed in my bed, I closed my eyes and I started to see thoughts take a visible image.
Just thoughts that manifested themselves upon me involuntarily.
I started to think about this one girl I never pay any recognition to.
Her face popped up and then she turned into like some skeleton that resembled a bug but still retained her facial image.
It was letting out some eery low screech (yes it was a low screech).
This scared the living shit outa me!
I ran to the bathroom and I looked at the mirror and my face was all contorted and didn't look right.
I got real scared and started praying to god.
This comforted me a little but everytime I looked into the mirror I just looked strange.
I still looked the same but I could see myself as I really was.
It was like my inner-beauty (actually innerugly) was surfacing.
I never noticed how many pimples I had, how oily  my skin was or how crappy I looked.
I never thought highly of myself but man, just when you thought you couldn't look any worse!
This all scared me deeply and I just prayed asking for it to end.
I tried playing some more games but the games were just too intense and took on a whole new meaning that wasn't appealing to me.
Just when I turned it off my dad asked if I could keep it down.
I said ok and my friend woke up and I told him how hard I was tripping he really didn't seem to be fascinated which seemed really odd to me.
We started talking for awhile and I begged him to not go back to sleep.
But he was being all bitchy and threatened me and I told him to chill out.
He did,he was just cranky from waking up he didn't seem to realize the seriousness of the situation.
It wasn't affecting him any(the peyote that is).
He gave me some sleeping pills and told me to chill out.
I was afraid to take them for fear that they would fuck me up even more, but he said they wouldn't and he wouldn't give me anything that would kill me.
I took his word for it and took them.
He went back to bed.
I layed down for what seemed like hours.
New songs of different genres played in my head, they sounded out of this world.
I didn't like it.
I looked at my hand under the covers and It looked very very odd.
It terrified me alot cause it started bleeding I looked away immediately cause it seemd so real.
I knew it was a hallucination.
I started telling myself of how stupid I was for even wanting to try this.
The effects were starting to taper off and I got tired and slept.
I didn't see any crazy geometric patterns or any of the crazy stereotypical bullshit I thought I would achieve if I took any psychadelic.
It was more of a mind game that my curiosity had to pay the consequences for.
The setting and mindset was all wrong.
If I could change this trip I would've done it during the day, in nature, away from any electronics and tripping with someone else.
And reduced my doseage.
After this experience, I have come to respect drugs and learned to not be so damn naive.
I finally got over what happened to me.
If it happened again I could handle the situation alot better since I have become a billion times more educated on the matter.

About six months ago a couple of my friends headed out to Rio Grande City to try and convice a couple of Indiands-who owned a peyote stand along the side of the road-to sell them about 40 buttons of freshly cut peyote.
I had my doubts, and had plenty reason to have them.
It was a poorly drawn up plan, and the drive was about an hour away.
I didnt think they'd come back with anything.
The very next day I asked them how it went, and I listened with a bemused 'i told you so' smirk on my face.
They were robbed.
Robbed by Indians.
An old drunk Indian with a necklace made from bone had come out of the house behind the peyote stand and made threats with a 22.
Apparently one of my friends was too white for their liking, but they managed to talk the Indian into 10 buttons for abour 40 bucks.
Yeah, they were ripped off.
About a month later I decided to go with three of my friends on a second trip back to the peyote stand.
This time we were greeted by two women who knew the Indian and snuck us a bag of about 50 dried buttons for 40 bucks.
Score.
The drive home was short; we were all excitied about the deal we had just struck.
A friend of mine had to give one of the women the shirt off his back to complete the trade (a darkside of the moon shirt, if you were wondering).
Two of us were 18, and the other two 17, so everyone had to clear it with their family, who were always curious to know where they'd be staying.
For reasons that kind of escape me, we choose my house.
I was okay with the choice, after all, I did have 9 acres of trees, grasses, and fairly exotic plants around my yard, as well as a maze of orchrids right behind my house.
Plenty of room to explore.
This would be my first experience with peyote.
I had tried mushrooms, 2c-e, mda, mde, mdma, dxm, nitrous, marijuana, and salvia up until that point.
I felt I'd be able to handle the mescaline inside these dried buttons, which resembled stale, rotten potatoe chips.
Around 11:00 p.m we each seperated the buttons into four relatively equal piles.
We each had 13 dried buttons that we began to chew in giant handfuls.
I'm not exagerating when I say peyote is the most disgusting thing I ever tasted.
I cringed.
My face contorted; I felt like spitting everything right back up.
Despite the warnings I had been given, I used water to wash everything down.
I had to.
The taste was so incredibly bitter that I felt suffocated by it.
Here the peyote had already humbled me and the trip hadnt even started.
About an hour had gone by and we all started to feel sick.
We went outside just incase we all started throwing up.
We didnt want to wake my parents to the sound of 4 guys violently puking their insides out.
We sat around a table with a sun carved in the center; it sat right agianst some bamboo trees and various types of plants.
I started to notice that everything had a water colored look to it.
Everything was painted so that the colors would run into each other.
I tried to put on some music, but I couldnt enjoy any of the tracks, and I certainely didnt want to force anything.
So I got sick of my cd player and tossed it aside in the grass and tried laying down to get rid of the churning inside my stomach.
I kept seeing light blues, purples, and tiny orbs when I closed my eyes.
Their spinning only made me dizzy.
Finally, I rolled over and puked.
My friend did the same.
After I relived the horrible taste of peyote for a second time, I found that I still didnt feel better.
But over the next couple of mintutes, I felt good.
We all went inside for a couple of minutes, the air outside was humid and making us sick.
None of us could tell just how far gone we were, because we all felt pretty normal despite some small changes in the visual field.
Soon we all started making jokes, and none of them were funny, but we laughed our asses off.
Our jokes started making less and less sense, and we were vaguely aware of it, but the more deranged it got, the funnier it was.
We decided to go back outside because all four of us felt crowded in my room.
We sat at our sun table agian and continued our idiotic display.
Is this what peyote did?
Turn us into babbling morons?
Soon my friend turned really serious.
Something was wrong with him, or maybe something was wrong with us.
He started talking crazily, about something metaphysical, only he was too inarticulate to paint the picture.
We were all confused.
About this time another friend of mine had become depressed; he told me if we left him alone that he would eat a gun.
We all decided to get out of that spot and take a walk.
We covered so much area looking over different parts of my propertey, wandering around aimelessly until we got tired and went inside for a break.
We had covered at least 9 acres, but when we got inside we were shocked to see that only ten minutes had gone by since we had been outside.
10 minutes?
We were all freaked out.
We knew we were out there for at least an hour or two, I mean, we had walked my etire propertey and had a conversation before we went walking.
It was at this point I began to feel a flood of emotions.
I couldnt decide which path to choose, which emotiont to feel.
I felt everything all at once for no apparent reason.
Confusion, happiness, hatred, love, uncomfortableness, sadness, I even felt stupid and enlightened at the same time.
I later thought it would be for the best if I seperated myself for a while, while everyone was outside.
I decided to try and listen to some music, so I looked for my cds the last place I thought I had seen them - in the kitchen.
Now, I don't remember any of this but my friends told me they saw me from two large windows in my living room, running furiously back and forth inside the house.
I remember walking, looking for my cds but apparently I had been sprinting.
Everything outside had been slowed down to a crawl, and everything in my house was sped up.
What a strange time warp.
As I headed outside, the wind picked up.
I still felt strange and out of place, and my friends all ran inside.
Except for the guy who continued talking incoherently, but eventually he went inside too.
I layed down in the grass for some time, shifting from many unrelated thoughts, seeing strange symbols, and getting dizzy.
I finally got up to a take a leak, and started thinking - what was so enlightning about peyote?
It's just a confusing mess.
A weird time dilation that never stops; I feel I've been out here days and I've learned nothing.
I started to feel like peyote was beneath me, and I even got a strange sense of confidence.
But just then something shook violently in the bushes next to me, and something seemed to come out of them but I was already too far to see what it was.
I didnt know I could react so quickly, and run so fast in just a couple of seconds.I couldnt think of what was in those bushes, because the bushes were relatively big and it would take a rather large dog to shake them.
Everything started to calm down as the night winded down.
There was towo trips that night, one I experienced, and the ones my friends had.
I was inside while they had been outside at opposite times.
I later learned they had went inside because of bright white lights coming over my roof.
They wouldnt elaborate and I didnt care to ask.
The night was strange.
Very strange.
I kept feeling other peoples emotions, and I felt like there was something next to me the entire night.
It seems silly, and it is silly.
But I can't really explain the conviction I had.

First, let me tell you about myself.
I live in Monterrey,Mexico and have a degree in psychology.
Being Mexican, please excuse any glitch in my English.
On September 16,1999 my brother in law and I took a trip to a town called Real de Catorce.
This little town is lost in the plains of northern central Mexico and is accesible only through a 2 kilometer tunnel.
The area is sacred for the huichol people and they go on a yearly pilgrimage to look for the sacred hicuri (peyote).
I was surprised the first time I went there to find many Americans and Europeans living there (this was my fourth trip, but the most interesting one).
Since my first trip I had been very curious about the peyote,but I was a little scared about it.
Fortunately on this particular time I met a man called El Camaron (shrimp in English)and we started talking about peyote and he turned out to know a great deal about it.
What really convinced my brother in law (his name is Jorge, by the way)and I about trying the peyote was that this man had only good things to say about hicuri.
He told us that we would learn a lot about ourselves and that, if eaten with respect and a purpose, hicuri would be good to us and that if our trip was scary,it would be that way for agood reason.
So Jorge and I decided to try it.
I think it is important to tell you about Jorge.
First of all, he is a great,sensitive guy and we have the best of the friendships, but unfortunately he is not a strong individual, he is a bit clumsy physically and this brought a lot of abuse from other kids when he was younger.We are both thirty-three now.
All of what I have told you and some other things made him a little bit insecure of himself.
On the other hand,I am strong secure of myself and through my life I have practiced extreme sports and things like that, so for Jorge I am like a big brother.
So we headed into the desert with a local guide and took only what we needed then we went to an abandoned mine and set camp.
We ate the peyote with great respect  and just kept talking of ordinary things.
About two hours after we ate the peyote Jorge vomited, but we felt normal.
After maybe another hour I was looking up at some tree branches and they started to turn more dense right in front of my eyes, and I thought 'this is it' at the same time the leaves of the trees started to glow like emeralds and everything exploded in a thousand colors and I felt one with the mountains and my surroundings there is one word to describe it:bliss.
And here comes the learning that the experience gave us,at a given moment I could actually feel terror coming out of Jorge,he did not looked scared at all but his fear was hitting me in the same way as if he were throwing something physical at me,at that time I asked him 'You´re scared shitless, aren´t you?
' And he was astonished that I could feel that because he was not showing any fear at all.I suddenly said,and to this day I do not why, 'You are dealing with your past'.
This made him very anxious and he told me 'How the fuck do you know all about what I am feeling?
How can you be so accurate?
'

To tell you the truth I don't know.
What I can tell you is that I had an incredible mental connection with my friend and I knew he was in trouble facing his demons, but as the hours went by I talked out of his fears and we started to enjoy a state of mind so beautiful so undescribable that to try to explain it would be like explaining a person who was born blind how is the color blue.At about six am we got into the tent and fell asleep.
The next day Jorge told me 'Now I know that I am capable of achieving many things I thought impossible,if I made it through that night in which I faced my deepest fears I can do anything'.
And so it was.
The next day we climbed a mountain and Jorge pitched the tent cut firewood and did things that the previous day he regarded as impossible.
As for me the mental connection was incredible and the feelings beautifuly overwhelming,and there is no doubt in my mind that the experience was one of the most enriching events in my life.
By the way, Jorge is now in college and people respect him a whole lot more than before that night in September 16, 1999.

The teepee was easily seen on the flat landscape, glowing from Grandfather-Fire, already keeping vigil within.
The site was, appropriately I thought, just down the road from an 'Indian Holiness Mission' church house.
The RoadChief and a few church members were already inside the teepee chatting.
We were warmly welcomed and advised to get our blankets and find our spots in the teepee as more folks were coming and space is always a factor.
In fact, the NAC is virtually the only church I can think of where regular services are commonly standing room only, with communicants driving or flying many hours each way.
At first, unfamiliarity makes sitting in a circle of folks, many meeting for the first time, feel a little strange.
However, something about sitting on the ground in the traditional lodge brings an ancient sense of holiness.
The commonality of all people soon becomes a tangible perception, particularly when sitting with inter-tribal groups where native folks don't even understand each other's language.
English becomes the common toungue when group discussions take place.
Language barriers soon fade as the night begins to glow with ancient magic...

Peyote chanting is accompanied by the rapid, steady beat of the water drum, an iron kettle with specially tied and stretched hide, partially filled with water, which aids its tonal and spiritual resonance.
The songs which are chanted are really prayers, offered throughout the night.
Many of the songs are learned apart from literal meaning, and are often sung by several people together, none of the participants understanding specific words, but all knowing the rythym and accents very well.
Some songs contain understandable phrases, many in english.
The water drum, singing staff, and rattle, are passed clockwise around the teepee, each person having the opportunity to lead prayer.
Those who pass bless themselves with the water from the drum skin and the energy of the singing staff.
The effect of this shared ritual and vocalization is intense, particularly when driven by the constant heart beat of the drum.
After the reason for calling the meeting (prayer for a sick person, birthday, memorial service, etc.
) is discussed with the congregation, peyote is blessed and passed clockwise, in the same manner as the drum.
People are free to eat as much or as little of the sacrament as they wish.
Sitting cross-legged or kneeling becomes a difficult task when peyote is first dealing with your system.
You begin to wonder how the RoadChief can maintain complete composure.
This night was not my night for purging however.
It was my wife's.
She was suddenly leaning gorking out the green contents of her otherwise empty stomach.
Folks don't seem to pay attention to this otherwise socially uncool act.
The FireChief tends to these occurences with a shovel and sand.
He also regularly sweeps the altar, walkways, and hot coals, keeping these orderly.
This makes it feel perfectly ok to throw up in church, as it were.
Usually, one feels much better immediately after vomiting, energy restored and attention focused.
Sitting all night becomes a pleasure, something you hate to see end.
The altar is made of sand and shaped in the form of a crescent.
A Chief Peyote is placed on the center of the crescent, to focus one's prayers.
The honesty of these events is often astounding.
Like other psychedelic sessions, personal issues are brought up, and the attention of the group is thus altered and applied.
Grown men and women weep with sorrow, thanks, joy.
Songs shared are windows into the soul of the individual.
At midnight the pace changes as RoadChief leaves the teepee to blow his eagle-bone whistle to the four directions.
Midnight water is brought in, blessed, and shared by all after first spilling some for the earth to drink.
Contentment and faith shine from the faces of the participants.
The ability of the RoadChief to make people feel welcome really makes these early morning hours enjoyable, and a strong sense of the Divine radiates the teepee.
New year's fireworks sounded in the background as we experienced our own internal diplay of light.
One very special moment was when small groups of people were invited to leave the teepee to stretch and refresh themselves.
The sound of praying and drumming combined with the flickering shadows around the teepee exterior was deeply inspiring.
By morning, we all felt very close to one another, almost as if we'd known each other for ever.
Morning food is brought in, one bowl is of corn, one of fruit, and one of meat.
These are blessed and passed clockwise.
I was happy to see that these bowls were three from my own hands, made several months ago for the RoadChief.
The sense of years of making pottery and my humble little studio on the banks of the Gila River entered the teepee and my mind.
I knew I was right where I was s'posed to be, doing just what I needed to be doing- with my life in general.
One of the most often repeated prayers that night was for 'good feelings'.
This is how it is with peyote.
It shows you that the way you feel is what you are.
It is good to feel good.
It is not good to feel bad.
Spirit is not something imagined, it is felt.

My Technique for Grafting Stock
Peyote & Cacti - T. peruvianus

Quite a lot has been written about the grafting of slow-growing cacti onto a faster growing base stock, and much of that has pertained specifically to accelerating the growth rate of Lophophora Williamsii, also known as Peyote.
However, most of what has been written has merely been about the actual grafting techniques, with vague references to the amount of growth acceleration.
While performing my own experiments with these illicit little wonders, I have come across some very interesting findings.
First and foremost, let me say this; I began growing cacti about two years ago.
I started with seeds, and after a month or so I had about twelve tiny Peyote seedlings, and eight Peruvian Torch seedlings sprouting from my seedling tray.
These grew indoors under a constant false summer climate for about a year before I grafted eight of the Peyote on top of the Peruvian Torch stock.
Unfortunately, this being my first time grafting any species of cacti, only two of the grafts survived.
This left me a bit heartbroken, but I still had four young Peyote growing on their own, and two that were growing exponentially.
At this point, my Peyote growing experience has hit the two and a half year mark, and certain things have come to light that will help me with future projects.
As it stands now, my two and a half year old cacti are doing amazingly, and my grafts are now one and a half years old.
While both Peyote grafts have only reached about one and a half inches in diameter, they have matured far past that point, and are both now beginning to sprout pups.
I have recently begun rerooting the larger of the two, and things are looking up.
What I noticed, however, is that the growth of the Peruvian Torch stock has halted almost exactly at size at which they were used for grafting.
This actually piqued my interest several months ago, and I have since tried a small experiment, with tremendous results.
This new Peyote experiment has actually given me much insight into speed-growing these little wonders, which may in the future help keep this endangered species from being completely annihilated in its natural habitat.
I began one day when I noticed that the Peruvian Torch, which I continued to grow after their Peyote grafts failed, were growing quite large and healthy.
I then compare them to the ones with surviving grafts, and noted a very remarkable difference in size and health.
This concerned me a quite a bit, so I set out that day and purchased a new Peruvian Torch.
The difference with this one, however, was that it was several years older, and about twelve inches tall.
When I came home that day, I picked out one of the surviving four Peyote I had left.
At this point the cacti were about two years old, and very healthy.
I grafted this Peyote on top of my new Peruvian Torch, and have babied it over the past several months.
It has now been about six months since that last grafting, and things have become painfully clear.
The new graft has reached, in a course of six months, almost the same size as my two and a half year old grafts.
While this didnt quite surprise me (common sense tells me that a more mature cacti would accelerate growth a bit more), what did was that which I noticed upon further inspection.
When I looked closely, I noticed that, while the Peyote was, in size, comparable to the two and a half year old specimens, it had not reached anywhere near them in actual maturity.
It was much like looking at the differences between a baby giant and an elderly dwarf.
While the two and a half year old specimens are already beginning to produce pups, the six month old graft of the same size is barely more than an enormous seedling.
While this is hardly a controlled experiment, I can cull from this experience two things.
One is fact; the amount of growth achieved by a graft is directly affected by the age and size of the grafting stock.
The other is theory, but one that is proving itself to be sound; the rate of maturity of Peyote, while affected by age and size of the stock, is not in direct relation to actual growth rate, and is proportionate more to the amount of time the Peyote is grafted.
I believe this is an essential piece of information; one could, in theory, graft a three year old Peyote on top of a twenty five year old Peruvian Torch, or other graft stock, and in a matter of months accelerate the growth rate years ahead.
I, personally, will continue studying this relationship for quite possibly the rest of my life.

I bought this peyote powder for $20 for '2 doses'.
I wasnt really educated but I figured it was a one-time deal, so I bought it.
Waiting for a good time to do it is hard when youre young, so when we had a weekday off of school I knew it was the right time.
I gave the friend that held the peyote half for helping me out.
So this stuff was fine grain powder, a greenish color with red, brown and orange speckles.
I mixed it in with a milkshake and was off.
First drink, horrible, made me want to throw it out and just stay sober.
But I fought through and in 10 minutes, the green milkshake was gone.
So now it was time to wait the time was about 7:15.
After my friend finished his, we headed up to his brothers room to chill.
At 7:45 I vomited my guts out.
But then I felt better.
This is when the trip began.
My friends brother had this mushroom poster and it was tripping me to death.
Peyote doesnt really make me out of control or dumber, but more or less simply different.
I was looking a everything different.
Well then I took a few hits off a bong and went into a dream world.
It was really fun, listening to the doors and chilling, looking at colors and patterns were the funnest.
Peyote was a great experience but it wasnt what I predicted, I thought I was going to be in a dream world, with floating colors and magic, but I was just seeing very little and felt like it was impossible to move.
My body tingled the whole time.

This individual got to try peyote a number of times around 1975-1977, sometimes dried/black/chewy, sometimes fresh/wet/gooey/green&dripping slime.
One would take 3 or 4 huge juicy ones, or perhaps up 6 dried little black ones.
Sometimes there was not much nausea, (after getting the totally yucky substance itself down), other times there was enough to puke once.
It passed though.
Actually I was more nauseous coming on to acid or mushrooms sometimes.
The hardest part is eating the shit.
I remember a very funny Zap Comix cartoon about gags to play on friends, and 'peyote toothpaste' was one of them...... argh, the memory of the taste would produce involuntary shivers of revulsion for many years afterwards, though it's faded by now, alas :-) 

Impression of the trip, from so many years ago, was that it was generally not as 'deep' and 'complete' as acid, not totally interconnected and composed of so many lines & patterns extending out towards infinity etc, not racing thoughts physically so fast.
It was very visual, perhaps less auditory than acid, perhaps lacking some of the strangest 'tactile hallucinations' from strongest acid trips where one felt as if one's hand actually touched a strange thing,....
Instead, there were pastel-colors, softer patterns, more 'natural' kinds of hallucinations, deep and profound thoughts but not quite on the uncontrollable express train.
Indeed, it felt extremely 'wise and mature' to the 18-20 year old subject at the time :-) 'The Smile of the Beyond' was one impression (named after a Mahavishnu Orchestra song, or maybe the other way around?
:-).
It went deeper than mushrooms, though, which sometimes appeared to place hallucinations on a giant balloon-like tension surface in front of the eyeballs.
Oh, yes I remember there were also lots of tinglies and chills, up and down the spine, even up and down the legs, everywhere there were nerves.... sometimes these blended with and turned into hallucinations.
It took a long time to come on, sometimes up to 2 hours.
Didn't last as long as big acid trips, maybe 6 hours or so.
The very first peyote trip for this individual was actually also this individual's very first 'bad trip' (after several pleasant acid and mushroom experiences), which was apparently necessary and instructive at the time..... one recalls waiting and waiting and waiting forever, doing too many bongs of headache weed, for it to start, then all of a sudden, a goat-like figure with nasty horns appeared in pentagrams on all the walls, nodding specifically at me, yes, YOU will freak out now, etc.
etc.
The tingles and chills turned into horrible scary flutters, rugs and grass and dirt would erupt with all sorts of tiny little creatures... 

oh yes, I remember, peyote hallucinations would often take on an animate quality of actual little individual creatures, faces with personality and history and dignity behind them, etc.

At the begining, right when it touches my mouth, I immedeately start to feel different.
I don't eat all 24-26 buttons at once, I I start out with about 2 fresh buttons that I chewed, they were cleaned (the Fuzz or Hairs were removed), then right after I ate about 4 teaspoonfuls of very dry finely grounded powder, then came the mush about another 4 teaspoonfuls, then throughout the night they will pass the peyote around and I came up with about 24-26 buttons but probably more like 30-34 buttons.
This is a very high dosage, I eat this plant quite often just about 2 times per month for the past 10 years sometimes I eat it every weekend for months straight.
Within the first 10-20 mins, I can feel my stomache start to ache, I start to belch a lot.
Slowly I start to feel the effects.
20-60 mins later, I start noticing that all light and objects seem to be more intense.
Everything starts to look sharp and bright.
1 Hour to 2 hours, I start to feel a lot of nausea, but I don't feel like puking, I probably would have if I would have made any sudden moves, I start noticing my thoughts start to move around more and they start to come alive, when I close my eyes I start to see blue, orange, Green, and red designs that are very brightly colored.
The designs that I start to see are very geometrical, and I start to even see the designs starting to form people and objects along with other things.
I can't keep my eyes open at this point as I can't keep my eyes in one place they start moving a lot, and I prefer to close in case they start to roll back and I start to freak out people.
Suddenly I start to go into some deep dream states, it's as if I'm having lucid dreams, they last very short seconds maybe just a second but a lot happens.
I start seeing other people's thoughts expressed to me in the form of dreams, I see intricate details of people, things that they only know.
I start hearing people talk to me in the dreams.
I start flying to the universe and I see bright bright colors now, the designs move slowly and not fast contantly changing like mushrooms do to me.
I see colored lights pass over me as if I'm flying in the universe filled with bright stars.
I suddenly find myself in a world where everything is crystal, and I see holy beings that look like Hopi Kachinas and a mixture of Northwestern totem poles a long with a japanese feel.
I start to receive info about my life and how to become a better person, I learn ways on how to be in life, humble, loving.
How to pray better, how to heal, how to find a better job, right decisions.
I moved around into different worlds and different thoughts.
Now 3-4 hours I've eaten the rest of the peyote, at this point i'm very nauseas and can't move much, I feel heavy and I see a lot of things now, I feel very emotional, and I feel like I want to stand up, but I can't, I still feel a lot of peyote in my stomache and I'm belching a lot now.
I now get the guts to walk around, the clouds are moving fast and I see bright colors everywhere.
Symbols, I start to hear a vibration, and I hear things in a different language, my thoughts sound like a different language, it's like a code, and I start to understand it clear, I learn the most beautiful things and some very bizarre understandings that make so much sense but there are no words to express this spiritual connection, but I've understood it quickly, I know that these teachings are a part of me even though I forget after this dosage.
I don't feel safe walking alone so I go back in the teepee and feel good.
I feel so happy, I can't take off this smile, I continue to feel like this, I see designs of many things.
Six hours later the nausea is almost gone but it comes in waves.
The peyote is still working on me very strong, 10-12 hours later I feel fine, still feel good and the effects slowly will go away.
I feel like a new person, I feel good alive and get this, days later I got what I asked the peyote to help me get.
The peyote told me it would be 4 days, and I got exactly four days later...what a good blessing.
I do not recommend this dosage, however I feel most people can't OD because one would most likely puke before they OD.
Be careful with this though it would never hurt ya, but can be quite scare if used incorrectly.
I would recommend not to mix with anything because it is such a potent healing medicine.

I just would like to first talk about this sacred plant of the Peyote, and mescaline one of the sacred chemicals in the plant, which I believe should all be consumed in the natural form and taken by itself to humble ourselves to the divine medicine.
I have been taking this sacred medicine now for two years.
Let me tell the you I've been searching all my life for many things that I cannot explain and now I believe I have found it.
I got involved with Drugs at age 21 with my ex we started to use Marijuana, then I got into MDMA, I became very addicted to ecstacy and could not stop.
I then knew of the Native American Medicine men who would conduct sacred ceremonies in Tee Pee's which would take place as all night prayer rituals including the usage of the Sacred Tobacco, and we would all be in a circle around the fire, the fire was in the center of the teepee, then next to the fire was the holy altar.
The Medicine man gave me a total of 8 buttons during the night and then we prayed all night singing and speaking our mind the teachings that came from our elders.
I had visions, beautiful ones, I was able to speak to the peyote, ask it to heal me, I asked for blessings to me and many others.
I saw a whole new world I was able to connect to the universe, I saw in the sky many Native american Designs like the ones you would see on Hopi Kathinas or in many pueblo arts and pottery also many Meso american Designs and I was taken to a world where there was colorful cactus everywhere.
I then saw, the constant movement of the universe and a web this interconnects us to every object, every prayer and every feeling idea.
I was able to see the many spirits that are in our lives at every time I even saw the Web/internet being another example of this web.
I saw issues in my life and noticed I faced all my fears each time I did that I noticed I would get sick and then it would all come out.
Sometimes instead of puking I would just burp or fart.
Near the end I would just see bright colors and my mind slowed down and my thought process was back to normal.
After this experience I had quit all drugs except the natural medicines in nature.
I now have good things and good people in my life, I still to this day continue to go to the ceremonies and I now want to go to mexico and south america to experience the Medicines including Mushrooms and Ayahuasca.
That is all for now I hope you all can get something good out of the usage of peyote and mushrooms respect them and use it all for a purpose and to heal.

Cacti - T. pachanoi
(extract)






With both parents on holidays in Bali and the house left for my sister and I to look after, I began preparation for what was to be my first psychedelic experience produced by the chemical Mescaline.
I had purchased the psychotropic plants from a cactus stall at the St Andrews markets in Melbourne.
Approximately twenty to thirty centimeters of the San Pedro cactus was sliced thinly and combined with one Peyote button.
This I then boiled in a large pot of water on the stove for at least ten hours while I was at school.
After this time the solid material was removed and the remaining liquid continued boiling until the broth was reduced to a fairly small amount.
Several days later when set and setting was right and I felt I was ready to take the substance, I sat before the altar in my bedroom and proceded to drink the dark greeny-brown liquid.
As I took the first mouthful of the substance from the chalice, I had trouble keeping myself from vomiting.
This was the most revolting thing I had ever tasted.
I was reminded of what Jim DeKorne said when he described its taste as something a curious preadolescent deity might dream up if he wanted to test to what extremes poor, benighted humanity would go to, to transcend its natural condition.

While waiting for the substance to take effect, I noticed a change in the way I perceived things.
No longer did I see objects as a whole, but realised that they were made up of millions and millions of smaller particles (cells or atoms perhaps), these particles were interwoven to create the whole.
The clothes I was wearing and the curtains in front of me no longer appeared as the every day objects I am used to, but were now totally alien to me.
Approximately two hours after taking the substance I decided to go bed.
I thought that if no visions or images had come to me by now, my chances of experiencing something enlightening were very slim.
I was so tired that I should have fallen asleep immediately, but once in bed I noticed a restlessness I had never felt before.
I likened it to what Albert Hofmann experienced early in his first LSD trip.
I was affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness.
At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated dreamlike condition, characterised by an extremely stimulated imagination.

This restlessness prevented me from sleeping and I quietly freaked out as more bizarre thoughts and feelings came to me.
At one point during the night the shape of my bedroom window went out of whack and began to bend and warp.
It was at this point that I decide it was time to move myself to another room.
For a while everything appeared to be back to normal, I believed that the effects had subsided and I was reentering my ordinary state of consciousness, little did I know that the most bizarre was yet to come.
It was once I began to nod off that I experienced the queerest sensation.
It was what I experienced at this point that had the most affect on me.
All of a sudden I woke up with the distinct feeling that I was in at least five different bodies all at the same time.
I am unsure if these bodies were all mine or whether I had taken possession of them, but each one was doing something totally different.
One was digging in a garden, one was flying a plane, and one was sitting up in bed wondering what the hell was going on, the thing was that all of them were fully awake.
Somehow the Mescaline had caused me to become one with various people and objects, this gave me a feeling that everything in existence is connected.
This is a universal belief found in many shamanic cultures, especially those that use the Peyote and San Pedro cacti as a means of altering their state of mind.
It is also a very popular belief amongst the old Celtic and Druidic cultures, which I have an intense interest in.
For the remainder of the night I slept quite restlessly as I continuously slipped in and out of an altered state of consciousness.
When I awoke the following morning I was filled with the greatest sense of awe I had ever felt.
I felt as though something inside me had been transformed forever.
Although I regret not being able to take these cacti in the same way that the Native Americans did in their sacred rituals, I still think that its possible for the modern man to experience the same illuminating visions that they were exposed to some two thousand years ago.
Although this is not a substance I would like to take too often I think it possible that Mescaline could be a catalyst for mans evolvement and that we should take this possibility into consideration when we decide that it should be an illegal substance.

I went to Camden Town Market today (September 2004), where I had heard there were a number of people selling mushrooms.
I thought I'd have to ferret them out in the back of the market, near the rasta incense guy and the questionable seafood stirfry.
No!
Right there on the main drag, at least a dozen places.
Most of them are selling mushrooms as an adjunct to an existing business (usually pipes & paraphenalia, sometimes shoes or leather jackets).
Amsterdam of London (where the price list is from) had four refrigerator cases full of mushrooms.
She said they'd probably sell them all by the end of the day.
They package them in those little plastic containers you see herbs at the grocery store in.
Some of the places, the mushrooms looked really icky.
Moldy, spotty, not at all fresh.
It just runs the entire range: from the guy selling leather jackets, lighters, and oh yeah mushrooms to Amsterdam of London with four cases and Camden Mushrooms with nice booths and good looking stuff.
However, where there's a will, there's one guy determined to make an empire.
That man is Thor, owner of the Camden Mushroom Company with 3 locations (Camden, Portobello, and Covent Garden).
I didn't get a chance to talk to Thor as he was helping customers and I had no plans to buy.
I did talk to his assistant and he seemed fairly knowledgeable, conscientious, etc.
He said they're not supposed to really talk about the 'experience' angle--you should know what you're getting into before you come buy, he said.
But they are willing to answer questions as to differences between the mushroom types in terms of experience.
They won't sell to anyone under 18 (which is common, but i don't see how you'd card anyone here) or to anyone who 'looks nervous'.
You can read the flyer they hand out from their stand at http://www.camdenmushroomcompany.com/ and email them at info@camdenmushroomcompany.com.
Thor seems to be the big player in town next to the Amsterdam of London people and probably more of a true believer.
T-shirts, booths, banners, flyers.
The Amsterdam people are just making bank.
I would mail him if you need more nitty gritty on the size and shape of the market, details, etc.
Obviously they are singularly focused.
When I asked the assistant to guess how many places he thought were selling mushrooms, he said, 'well you can see probably like a dozen places from right here.
' And that's not counting all the various places set up in basements and backrooms of stores with a sign on the street.
Some other places are less focused.
I did see places with actual cactus in a pot for sale, but I have no knowledge of whether they were legit or not.
It could have been 99-cent Garden Center cactus for all I know.
Prices on the Amsterdam board are probably close to what almost everyone was charging, give or take, here or there.
It seems like there's a lot of competition.
Camden Muchroom Company guy mentioned they just dropped their prices to be a little more in line with everyone else.
One curious thing, they all had the exact same packaging.
That made me wonder if there was a main distributor outside of the two big players.
Something that bothered me was that they all had the same crappy single page  'info' sheet on mushrooms: it was vague and unhelpful saying things like 'Experience a wonder of delights...'  The wording sounded like an advertisement for a pastry shop to me.
The 'information sheet' was a list of the different strains of mushroom they were selling with such useful tidbits as:

Mexican (Psilocybe Cubensis)
These mushrooms will give you a happy trip, with nice visuals, laughing and trippy thoughts.
Social and comfortable.
Recommended for first-time users.
The trip will last 4-6 hours.
Indians (difficult to read on my photo ??
)
These mushrooms will give you a very wavy feeling with a happy trip, nice visuals, laughing and trippy thoughts.
Social and comfortable.
If you like the Mexicana, then you will love the Indians.
The trip will last 4-6 hours.
Thai
These mushrooms will give you a trip like the Mexican, but a little stronger and little more thinking.
The trip will last for about 5 hours.
Columbian
These mushrooms will take you to another level, not recommended for the beginners.
The trip will last for about 5-6 hours.
Hawaiian Copolandia
This is the strongest kind.
This trip is very visual and very intense.
The effect will last about 6-7 hours.
Not recommended for the faint harted [sic].
etc.

Drove down to Mexico Jan. 2002.
Went to a great little town and a lot of people were offering to take us out into the desert to get some peyote.
We declined since they all offered horses.
We tried the next town.
There we managed to get someone to take us to some peyote by truck.
We had commited ourselves to eating in the desert, the natural way, but ended up taking it back to the town with us because, well, we were really just looking for a high not a spiritual experience.
We shut ourselves into our hotel room (a concrete cube, really) and ate the peyote.
I had gotten four, having heard that less then three was a waste of time.
I only ended up eating three though, because it was the most foul tasting filth I had ever tasted (worth it though).
We all had ones with about 10 to 14 segments.
After about half an hour (maybe more) I started to feel a little off, not really high.
Even at the time I couldn't really tell how I was feeling.
Then, I closed my eyes.
I saw the craziest stuff without even thinking about it; it was like my brain was just showing it to me.
Stuff like bright lime green and sun yellow bottles streaming through a bottling plant.
All very cool, not bad at all, all I had to do was open my eyes and feel normal again: very controlled feeling.
After a while my frinds started reading some poetry by federico garcia lorca.
I had never heard it before and it really started messing with the strange visuals on my eyelids.
Soon everything I saw was all vomit and blood.
I saw a bunch of bees decending on a feild of shallow graves giving birth to human babies into them; the babies were then carried off by large beetles.
That was the worst of it though.
And still opening my eyes seemed to help.
After I don't know how much time (maybe an hour, hour and a half) I could see minor visuals with my eyes open; stuff like patterns in the stucko ceiling.
We went out to the train platform to see if we couldn't see a train.
Being out in the daylight was strange; I felt very self-conscience.
The one guy in our little group that spoke spanish found out that the train didn't stop in wadley anymore, but it came through pretty regularly.
I chose to sprawl myself out on the platform while my buddies sat down.
Eventually, we realized that a family lived in the train station and left to watch for trains from the roof of our hotel.
We watched the train go through town, but not too long after that the power went out in town and I started getting freaked out and was begging to leave.
We dove out of wadley as I was coming down and we saw a burning tractor trailer on the side of the road (a little strange while coming down.
I would set the overall time at about four hours of definitly up time.
I probably should have eaten the fourth one I had harvested, but I didn't waste it; I ended up giving it to our desert tour gide.
Note: I have closed eye visuals very easily; sometimes just from getting stoned and drunk.
But, now that I mention it, it seems to have become more regular since the peyote experience.
Actually, I can't remember a single instance of it before the Mexico trip.
Maybe it showed the way to some unexplored region of my brain.
Maybe I'm just a light weight.
The latter is probably the case.

Nestled in a secluded, high southwestern desert valley, there exists a quasi-legal, all-race peyote-using church.
I say quasi-legal because protection for growing its sacrament, peyote, is by state statute alone, not Federal law.
Officially formed in the late seventies, the church has thrived for many years fighting for all-race religious peyote use.
Based upon the tenets of the Native American Church and fused with some of the doctrines of Mormonism, the church teaches love, holiness and a respect for nature that is literally awesome to behold firsthand.
As I arrived at this seemingly barren location late one afternoon, I wondered what I would encounter in such a brutally hot desert locale.
I was not disappointed.
All I can say of the weekend experience is that it all finally made sense to me.
Greeted at the door by the original founder of the church, I was received with open arms and immediately felt the love of my hosts.
I was given a brief tour of the humble premises and was then shown the Peyote House where over 1,000 peyote cactuses were growing.
One of the apostles proudly displayed a collection of illegal sacred plants.
I asked how the church could operate such an openly illegal practice given the strict Federal laws regarding the growing and harvesting of peyote, at which she replied that their state and the surrounding community have taken great pains to protect religious freedom.
Being a predominant Mormon community, the area has had its fair share of religious disputes with the Federal government in regard to religious freedom.
For the most part though, the Federal government has turned a blind eye to the religious practice of growing peyote for religious purposes.
After settling down and setting up my tent on their land, I was awed by the beauty of nature that surrounded me.
The desert was teeming with life and a home nearby was decorated in colorful pottery, which supports the financial aspect of the church.
Leaders of the church spend hours working on the pottery and seem to pass the time peacefully in intelligent conversation.
It is solely up to these individuals to decide whether or not one is worthy, so to speak, of partaking of the holy sacrament.
Upon my arrival, I can honestly say that I did not know whether or not I truly wanted to participate in their sacrament or whether I was prepared for the experience.
This said, my first test, it seemed, was with the founder of the church.
He is a kind and gentle 25% Native American man who asked where I came from and the purpose of my visit.
We spent time in rocking chairs while he introduced me to all of the pets and the wildlife that regularly visited the window of the house.
He told stories of his military service in World War II and unselfishly imparted his words of wisdom upon me about the meaning of life, the history of his legal troubles, and his fight for all-race peyote use.
Though he is a dedicated servant to the church, I felt no pressure from him to comprehend the complexities involved in using peyote and I was unsure of what he thought of my responses to his many questions.
One thing I did know for sure, this man had religious and social convictions that were on par with any man I have ever met.
My apparent test continued through the night and into the next morning while I had pleasant conversations with other leaders of the church as they told me how they met the churchs founder and how they were able to obtain and sustain such a great quantity of peyote.
They mentioned their love and respect for their Mormon neighbors, who have paradoxically been some of the most ardent protectors of their religious freedom in the area, although Mormonism in no way advocates their use of the controlled substance.
I began a fast in the morning at the recommendation of one of the apostles and spent my time hiking and exploring the wonders of the desert location.
I love the mountains and hike quite often, but nothing could prepare me for what would happen that night.
I assume I passed their test of sincerity since I was soon to be given a peyote tea.
I was honored at this gesture and listened intently as the apostles explained what to expect, if anything.
Again, I was not disappointed, for that night was the night I saw the stars dance.
The peyote sacrament was prepared in a tea, and I was also given two dried capsules of peyote to help enhance my experience with the medicine. I signed some legal papers reporting that my use of the substance was for purely religious purposes and off to the desert I was sent for what is called The Spirit Walk. Unlike the structure and ritual of the NAC peyote ceremony, The Spirit Walk is a solitary journey that the churchs founder reminded me was the key to finding out the answers to difficult questions.
The leaders disdain for the rigidity and structure of organized religions was painfully transparent, and for the first time, soon before I began my walk, I think he actually preached as a Christian zealot that he believed this was the only way one could come to understand what The Peyote Way, what life in general, was all about.
I retired to my tent slowing ingesting the most disgustingly bitter tea of my life.
As I relaxed on a lawn chair, literally in the middle of nowhere, I awaited the effects of the psychoactive substance in peyote, mescaline, to take effect.
Ever so slowly, my body began to feel warm and intensely uncomfortable.
A small buzz arose in my ears and it culminated in what seemed like the vomiting of the entire tea that I consumed over the space of about an hour.
I swallowed the peyote capsules given to me with a splash of water, and slowly but surely, everything finally made sense!
All the years of my research and reading began to unfold before my eyes.
The Is-ness of Huxley, the tune in of Leary, the set and setting of Smith all fell into place as I watched the moon begin to brighten with an intense array of color.
The trees and the ground below me were infused with what I can only describe as life. Their colors, though it was now well past dark, were a heightened green and brown with spots of red, blue and yellow.
As I looked up into the beautiful night sky, I noticed that my mouth had been wide open in awe for quite some time because my throat, lips and mouth were entirely parched.
I soon became consciously aware of why this was the case: I was watching the stars dance.
I understood now why Huxley had such a hard time describing his mescaline experience in words within his book Doors of Perception.
I understood why the set and setting so ardently defended by Huston Smith played such an important role in this experience.
My mind was entirely preoccupied with what I would normally to have considered trivial.
The rocks on the ground exploded with color, the stars ebbed and flowed with the music I was listening to and I began to sing as loudly as possible.
An overwhelming sense of joy and even a sense of love infused my whole body.
So I started to laugh, very loudly.
I laughed so hard I began to cry.
My tears were not tears of sadness or of pain, but of a giddy and even childish joy at all that was occurring to me.
My body seemed to melt into the lawn chair and I felt as if I was part and parcel of everything around me.
Then came Huxleys infamous heaven and hell experience.
Huxley wrote another book soon after Doors of Perception about his mescaline experiences in which he describes something similar to R. Gordon Wasson calls Ecstasy. However, as Wasson reports, ..ecstasy is not fun.
Your very soul is seized and shaken until it tingles. I was so overtaken by the visual sensations that I was experiencing I retired inside my tent for a while.
What awaited me was the hell and a sense of guilt and horror at all of the things I had taken for granted in my life.
I reflected on the words of the church founder when he said you can learn more by following the path of the fly than the words of a preacher.
I believe this simple phrase was meant to remind me that we are all somehow metaphysically connected to everything around us and no preacher can teach us the sublime nature of such a doctrine.
Although the preacher may be able to tell a person of the ontological importance of such doctrine, to actually follow the path of the fly, aided by the peyote experience, give a direct personal contact to what the preacher can only talk about.
I could not tell if I was talking to God or not, but what was happening to me felt like a direct experience of something divine.
Though reminded of my imperfections, I was imbued with a renewed sense and desire to overcome my imperfections and to somehow make them right.
The beauty all around me was evidence enough to convince me that I had to do something different with my life and to perceive the world in a better light.
I had to change some things and become a better father, husband and person.
I finally understood why there was such an overwhelming respect for this cactus and why it leads many Native Americans (and others) to shun alcohol use and other intoxicating substances.
In everything, I saw... goodness, and I inexplicably felt I was part of that goodness.
By this time I had lost all sense of time and sleep escaped me.
I returned outside (admittedly a little disoriented) to see my dancing stars and started a small fire, which is recommended by the clergy of the church if conditions are favorable.
I gleefully watched for what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes as the smoke and fire dwindled into the most beautiful embers of fading light.
I noticed that the mescaline was finally starting to wear off because my stars began to be fixed in their places, and I succumbed to my fatigue and fell into a blissful rest.
So what does this story have to do with harm?
Well, nobody was harmed by the use of peyote except for my family who had to endure my being gone on a three day long trip to the desert.
The right set and setting aided me in finding out some crucial information about an illegal substance revered by many a portion of the divine substance. The fact that I felt a part of that divine presence evoked a pleasure that I shared with my host the next morning.
As I broke my fast that morning with oranges, grapes and nectarines, I savored the sweetness of each bite.
In contrast to the bitter peyote, I found that even a piece of gum was immensely tasteful.
I conversed with the church founder about my experience and he again showed no signs of pushing the importance of the religious use of peyote.
His only concern was that I learned from the personal, solitary experience and that I let no other interpret what I had felt and seen.
In regard to that last sentence, I honestly do not know how to interpret what I felt and saw.
I admit that years of research did make a lot of sense to me after ingesting peyote, but I am still at a loss to describe what happened to me.
The naturalist/physicalist in me wants to explain away the experience by an appeal to the scientific evidence of how mescaline affects brain function.
My religious leanings point to a holy and sacred experience that I share with the reader in story form, hopefully with reverence.
I do not know if I will ever take a hallucinogenic substance ever again.
It is not that I am presumptuous enough to claim I have learned or experienced all there is to know about these experiences, but quoting Alan Watts, When you get the message, hang up the phone.  For now I have received enough of the message concerning the religious and recreational use of hallucinogens.
I respect the fact that others consider these substances sacred and holy or even just pleasurable and I share my peyote experience only to show that their religious use can and ought to be protected.
Although I am just as honest in defending that given the right set and setting, the hallucinogens recreational use seems to be as benign and harmless as their religious use.
Hallucinogenic substances do appear to be a boon that with the right kinds of controls and education could be used to benefit many a person.
I just hope that my story helps relay the importance of more protection for our beloved nations liberties in regard to hallucinogenic drug use.

Peyote






Nearly a decade ago, I first journeyed to Wirikuta, the sacred land of peyote.
The name Wirikuta has similar meaning for the Huichol people of Mexico as does our word heaven.
Members of this tribe have been ceremonially re-enacting the peyote 'hunt' for as long as they can trace their origins.
So it was that my interest in peyote and peyote people led me to this desolate, but magical desert valley.
Traveling to Mexico was definitely not in my plans that fall.
Work, finances, and family made it a pretty sure bet that any traveling I did would be done close to home.
Enter Prem Das, an American married into the Huichol tribe who at that time was based in Tepic, Nayarit.
He had originally contacted me by phone after reading an article in a popular magazine which I had provided information for.
The article had been about peyote and its legal use in Arizona.
Prem Das had been an avid student of peyote for several years.
He let me know that if I shared his interest, I should make my way to the sacred valley of the Huichol as the next step in my own relationship with the sacrament.
He listened patiently to all my reasons for staying home and being too busy to be bothered with spiritual travel adventures.
One day, while visiting my home, Prem Das pulled an airline ticket out of his bolsa.
(shoulder bag) It was my ticket to Puerto Vallarta, flying with him and his wife to go visit their Huichol family.
I was very happily surprised, but also disappointed with myself for knowing that I couldn't just pack up and hop on a plane within 48 hours, no matter how much I might like to.
Life was way too complicated, and I, way too previously occupied for that.
I politely declined his generous offer.
That night we attended a peyote ceremony co-hosted by myself and members of a local artisan community.
Prem Das was the roadman for the evening.
I mentioned to my artist acquaintances the airline ticket and my inability to accept it.
Out of friendship and the concern for Prem Das's wasted purchase, I asked my artist friend, Sharon, to travel to Mexico in my place.
She somewhat hesitantly agreed after hearing out my situation.
I had not however, counted on the working of the spirit of peyote...
The medicine was very strong that night.
During the peak of the ceremony, while my body sat apparently content, my inner being was in great turmoil.
I sensed my life as I knew it had reached its natural conclusion.
All my roads were leading nowhere.
Life for me, had become a charade.
The driving tone of the water drum and Prem Das's chanting, normally very comforting, now seemed to stir my pot of doubt and insecurity until I could feel my spirit boiling over and evaporating into emptiness.
Nothing in the world could at that moment have quenched my thirst for meaning, my hunger for purpose.
Nothing, that is, except the hand of God.
In my mind's eye I saw a weeping child (me) surrounded by empty space.
Into that loneliness, a white, silvery eagle suddenly appeared.
It swept down towards my vacant self, coming in for the kill, I thought.
After all, my life felt more corpse-like than alive.
As the sharp talons opened to grab its human prey, I suddenly felt the lifting of my self pity and perhaps even fear.
I was glad just to be able to let go and die in peace.
Unexpectedly, I began to feel the eagle warm and bless me rather than scattering my soul to the void.
A physical and spiritual blessing radiated from the eagle into my body, beginning where its formerly frightening talons now gently touched my head.
I felt the peace of heart and mind that only God's Spirit can bring.
Instantly, I realized that it had been too many years since I had fully bathed in God's healing light, too long running on my own knowledge and neglecting the daily blessings of Spirit.
I awoke from my vision with tears streaming down my face.
I looked across the fire as the drum beat on and saw my friend Sharon watching me, smiling.
I spent the rest of the night in meditative prayer, thanking God for the simple miracles of life.
In the morning, everyone who had participated in the ceremony visited with each other and shared some of their experience.
I sought out Sharon to thank her for standing in for me and accepting Prem Das's gift.
'I want you to see what I drew last night around the fire' she said.
She opened up her sketchpad which she often carried, artist that she was.
With an understanding smile she showed me a pencil drawing of a white eagle coming to rest on the shoulders of a kneeling man.
'That's what I saw when I looked at you last night, when you wept.
' she said.
'I think you should go with Prem Das yourself.
'

Almost in shock, I agreed.
That was when Wirikuta welcomed me into itself and began to shape a new creature from an old lump of clay.

For those of you out there who know of Jim Morrison and the Doors, and the magic they wove into their electrifying rock-poetry, perhaps some of you know of Jim's Peyote trip in the Deserts outside California...
Seeing as how I have always been interested in Jim's life, and wondering how he lived and why he did the things he did...I decided what better way than to try to see what can be seen on the powers of Mescaline in its purest form: PEYOTE cactus.
So to make the long story short, i made some phone calls and obtained some peyote a few weeks later.
So one night in my room, I decided to ingest the peyote, and yes it tastes foul.
After about two hours, i could clearly start seeing objects starting to change vividly in shape and color.
Now with LSD, usually the things you see are formed out of objects in your line of vision...with Peyote you see things, spirits, animals... everything the universe has to show us.
I wandered outside, and began to walk the dark streets of my neighborhood.
I could see in black and white, the forms of spirits who once lived on the land where I call home now.
They were so clear and real, and they knew I was there.
Somwe of these people looked as if they were startled that a living being was in their world, yet others seemed to understand that I just wanted to heal my mind, and learn whatever I could.
At some point in my trip, I heard what sounded like the wind calling me...
I turned around--directly into the face of an indian brave, feathers in hair and everything.
His lips moved, and so faintly I could hear the words...'look to la Luna..'  'look to la Luna'

'LOOK TO THE MOON'  I realized that is what he was trying to tell me.
I looked around for the moon, only to see three moons in the sky, 1 blue 1 yellow, and 1 red as blood.
As i glanced at each moon, i felt a different sensation wash over me.
Blue:  calm, sereneity, and the sound of water washing up on sandbeds....Yellow: fear of the unknown, and what is to come in my future....  RED:  was the most disturbing.
As I looked to the Red moon, my vision suddenly just flew me into the moon, wghere I could see only red flame and hear unsettling sound from beyond my line of vision...
I suddenly felt the need to close my eyes, and when I did so, I saw a scenerio of myself struggling in water, seemingly like I was drowning?
As soon as I saw this, i was transorted back to the 'world' where there was now only one moon, and the feeling of many things around me at all times, even though I could no longer see them.
For hours I contemplated life, until the trip began to make me nauseous.
I vomited after about 12 hours into the trip.
By now, back in my house, i was still seeing wonderful colors, and feeling like something was watching me...
I felt the need to sleep.
And sleep i did after about two more intense hours.
I have to say that after I woke up the next night, I felt so refreshed, like all my baggage had been lifted, and i also felt somehow like something serious was about to happen.
I am still waiting for a big event, that I know will happen, but Peyote did not reveal the time or place...so I will patiently wait, or perhaps, the secret will be revealed on my next journey to 'la Luna.

About eight friends and I were going out raving after having not raved for nearly 6 months expect for a month ago.
Four of us were taking Syrian Rue plus san pedro but I was the only one taking peyote as well.
Of the four of us there was Brain, Robert, Anthony and myself.
Brain and I are the only ones who have taken cactus at a rave and Anthony was a cactus virgin.
Before this I have consumed san pedro at least 10 times a peyote twice.
Syrian rue is a wonderful tool that allows one to get the most out of cactus ingestion by increasing the effects by a factor of 2 1/2.
CAUTION MUST BE TAKEN WHEN USING AN MAOI such as syrian rue as they can be very harmful or even fatal if miss used!!
The four of us took the syrian rue at 9pm after not eating for the whole day (this is highly recommended as it greatly reduces nausea).
At 9:30 in the car park outside the rave we started the task of drinking the san pedro juice.
Normally I mix fresh lemon juice in with the san pedro to cover the bitter taste but tonight I just wanted to drink as much as I could stomach, so lemon juice was not added.
The taste was horrid like always so we scold a glass at a time and this was quickly followed by a glass of juice.
Anthony, Robert and I drank 3 glasses but all we all choked and brought the third glass back up.
There was still more juice but we decided to leave it for next day.
The four of us told the others we were going for a walk to get Quick Ease (also helps reduce nausea).
On the way I chewed my peyote button and started to feel the pedro coming on.
By the time we got back to the car park I was seeing tracers of everything.
Cars and other metallic objects had shiny hazes around them when I moved my head.
So far I had only the warmth buzz that I always get from pedro and some nice visuals but the cactus had not yet affected my thinking.
Standing in the line up I started to space out, it was hard to take part in a group conversation as I tended to loose track of what was being said.
Once we were in we headed for the back of the dance floor to meet our friends.
I sat down and closed my eyes and like my previous experience I was lost in a world of clear soft and warmth patterns.
After closing my eyes for about 2 minutes these patterns changed into vivid images.
These images started to tell some type of story.
One I remember clearly was seeing a clear sky turn cloudy then the clouds turned darker and cause a bolt of lighting to fall from the sky and strike a forest tree.
This tree then burst into flames and started a fire that threatened to destroy the entire forest.
Next it started to rain and the fire subsided.
After the fire was completely diminished the clouds broke apart and the sun shone brightly upon the forest as smoke rose from the ground cleared by the fire.
This just one of the many short stories that I experienced and I remember it clearly because of its simplicity.
All these short stories as I will call them were experienced with a natural feeling of understanding no matter how abstract the visions were.
I have found that acid visions of this magnitude are normally coupled with feelings of confusion and sometimes even fear and panic.
After opening my eyes I realised that I was at the back of the dance floor something I have momentarily forgotten.
I looked at my watch only to find that I had been at the back of the dance floor for 5 minutes.
I told Anthony who looked surprised and said that had felt like about ½ hour.
The two of us decided to go for a walk.
As I walked along the dance floor it seemed as people I could not see properly and appeared to me as shadow like objects that were not living.
By this time I was also experiencing warmth body tingles and strong feelings of euphoria.
I spent the next ½ hour walking around talking to people I had not seen in a long time and lost Anthony is the process.
Holding one-to-one conversation was normal while group conversation was still a bit of a lost cause.
I run into my brother and his friends who were looking to get some E (they hadnt had rue or pedro).
My friend and I went looking for some people we thought could help us out while my brother and the others did their own thing.
The police presence at this event was a lot higher than one would normally expect for a rave of this size.
As such getting on for E turned into a hit and miss affair on numerous occasions.
I spent the most of the nite running around looking to get on for my friends but instead running into people and talking for most of the nite.
I was able to dance but not for long periods of time without my legs feeling tired.
During the nite I also revisited the places that were made accessible by closing my eyes and forgetting about what was taking place around me.
Occasionally people would tap me on the shoulder and ask, Are you alright?.
By now it was 3 am the cactus was feeling different now, I think the peyote had fully kicked causing the change.
The physical sensations like tingles and rushes that I had felt earlier were not as pronounced but the overall experience felt like it had changed its path.
This change was neither positive or negative it just something that happened.
As the night came to an end I my brother and his friends headed off on the long drive home while brain and I started our trek to his sisters house.
We farewelled everyone then walked to the train station.
We walked past a group of people who had also just left the rave all of which were dreading the walk to the station where as Brian and I found the walk quite pleasant.
We spent a couple of hours there not doing a great deal then we headed back home.
Back at home my brother and the others were asleep.
I made myself a sandwich and spoke to my neighbour who had missed out on the nite before then spent to bed about 4:30 pm and woke at about 10:00pm that nite and had dinner with my mum then went back to bed.
I woke the next day at 9:30 with very peaceful afterglow sensation that stayed with me for most of the day.

I went with some friends from a New Age bookstore to go a native Indian sweat lodge.
We were there all weekend.
My wife was invited to go, but at the last minute changed her mind.
I dont think she would have liked it much any ways; it was a lot of roughing it, campfires, rain, hard ground and an odd assortment of food.
But then again, it is an attempt to get back to native ways, so it was very appropriate.
We arrived at 7pm and did a sweat, then ate some food, to get ready for the Medicine tent at midnight.
At that point we spent the whole night in a full size teepee, with the fire going in the inside, and it raining on the outside.
Of course there was very little sleeping since it was a ceremony with prayers, singing and so on, we werent encouraged to sleep (they would poke at you if you started to dose off or get too comfortable.
Think of it as a self-imposed endurance test.
The most provocative part of course was the Medicine Tent, the teepee.
We didnt know what medicine was, thinking maybe that we might smoke some grass or some thing like that.
I myself have only smoked it on occasion and had never taken any psychedelic drugs of any kind.
However, it was much more of an endurance test than that.
They gave us three types of Peyote, one in a dry granola form, one in a wet gritty and spongy form and then as a tea.
As soon as I had choked down the one bite, they would pass the bowls around again.
This happened 5 times.
It was awful.
It tasted like gritty wet cow pie, and was insanely bitter.
To get well or throw up, was expected as part of the treatment.
I am not one to throw up so I endured it only to have it effect me for the next few days as it would work its way out of my system, I could hardly keep any food in me I had such diarrhea.
We were told we all had a significant amount of it, and that the effects in the medicine tent were going to be different than if we took it on the outside.
However it also stands to reason that no one in his or her right mind would endure this as a recreational drug.
It was too horrible.
I am not sure what others experienced during their vision questing, but I was beginning to see some visions, even though we were told this was not a hallucinogenic, but rather for clearing and focusing the mind.
Predominantly I saw the fire's timbers pulsating, and the embers took on the shape of spines and bones, skulls and faces.
The face of the old man sitting on the far side of the teepee was clear to me with his long beard and sharp nose and features.I looked up from the fire, and it was him to the detail, he was already looking at me from across the fire with his steel blue eyes.
I felt I knew him from some were, even a past life.
He looked like the wizard.
Other images came to mind later.I couldnt imagine any one meditating from all the boisterous singing, the sharp stabbing pain in our backs as we lay on the hard floor and of course the waves of nausea that flooded over with each dose of the cactus.
Many of the experienced practitioners made a hasty retreat for the door as they felt the bitter drug coming back up their throats.
But even then I look back and recall all the fears that were welling up in me, that feeling of the native wanting to claw its way out, contrasted by the scared white man that wanted to run away from this crude uncivilized world I was experiencing.
I could see my fears in front of me, and they seemed to take shape, they were real and tangible, and floated in front of me like shapes.
I listened to the voices in the teepee around me and they were unfamiliar, Spanish, Lakota, and even French.
They all seemed to speak above me, and leave me out, paranoia set in about what they might be saying, maybe about me.
I could see what looked like many lifetimes as a white man, and his western mind obsessed with comfort, cleanliness, and desire to be a separate ego and pride as an individual.
This feeling of community and back to nature was now alarming me with fear.
Fears of nature, panic of the lack of comforts, like electricity, and warm sugary and processed food.
The feeling was irrational if it was just from my surroundings, but I felt this feeling of not being at one with the savages, and the lack of understanding and conflict the western mind has with nature and that which he cannot control came from many life times.
Not just my past lifetimes, but the lifetimes of my white ancestry, it was in my blood and DNA, breed into me, by my great, great, grandparents who also knew of this white fear.
Why is it when the lights blink out for an hour it is the topic of conversation or the traffic light on the corner is outwhite fear.
What about the grocery not having a certain item we want or gas prices rising, forcing us to consider alternatives to our comfortswhite fear.
Of those that are different skin than us, those that speak of foreign tongues, they could take overwhite fear.
What of those that worship in nature, a female mother goddess, frightening nakedness, and a religion that talks of becoming one with the earthwhite fear.
The music, that I knew on the outside I had identified with and longed for, was now beating harshly on my ears, the earth I wanted to bond with was now ground into my every pore, the sense of oneness with others was forced on me as we huddled sweaty and naked together in darkness.
I had so often longed to get away from the faults and obsessions that Americans embrace.
I dont understand or appreciate most of popular culture and its escapist fantasies.
But now, here in my new tribal world I felt like a stranger, and I shuddered and panicked at the experience of not having the comforts that I was so accustomed to.
The following breakfast ceremony was equally brutal to my stimulus.
Cold corn and cold buffalo meat didnt appeal to my stomach that now turned inside out.
Then it was dawn, and I was exhausted.
They allowed us to collapse momentarily, and even as bodies walked around and over me, I could hear them in the distance talking, but I ignored it all.
I couldnt tell the drugs effects from sleep depravation.
Then about as the sun was rising, and the rain was breaking up, we huddled to the outside fire again and waited.
The second sweat, they promised would be very meaningful and empowering.
I crawled in to the hut, on the cold and wet dirt floor; my sense of smell could no longer detect sweat or the pungent smoke that permeated everything.
The girls were on one side and the men on the other.
They held peace pipe, and as the stones were brought in by the fire bearers one by one, they touched the tip of the pipestone bowls to the red hot rock grandmothers, 28 stones in all.
Then they lit the pipes, and as they were stoked I marveled at the ceremony, as each one silently gave reverence to the 4 quarters, their pipe, the sky and earth, and spun them around to the next person.
It was quite beautiful how synchronized it became.
Soon, one by one the large pipes let out their last breath of smoke and the door was closed to the wig wham.
This time it was different.
I couldnt see the light and it felt like night had descended again.
When the singing and ceremonies began the steam rolled off the hot rocks and I could feel my face burning.
I looked up and saw faces again, this time in the faint outlines of light that snuck into the walls.
The faces were of ancestors, but also of death.
The grim reapers face formed, as if again saying I am the great white death that all your people have faced. Another face emerged and it was in a war paint, streaming down vertically on a painted white face.
I believe it was a Crow tribe, and their war paint.
Both loomed in eminent death.
The smaller face of the native death, held more strange fear and anger than the familiar and stereotypical face of the Reaper.
They both seemed to wink at me and I could almost hear them say, be good kid with a laugh.
I knew they were goading me and teasing.
I responded in my mind, there is no good or bad me, just me!
To which they seemed to knowingly nod, approvingly.
At least they would not take me with out me having first learned this lesson in life.
When I finally thought I had faced all my demons and fears, the door flew open one last time, and the babe that the parents wanted to bring in was handed in wrapped naked in a fresh towel to the mother.
We closed in what was called a baby sweat, and I awaited one last final and mild steam to come over me.
It turned out to be the straw that broke my will.
The child was brave, and I thought to my self, it is us that fear the womb, not the child who probably hated to have recently left it only months ago.
Finally the heat and the water, splashing on him gave him to raise his cry in discomfort.
All of our parental meters went into overdrive, and the women as much as the men were shifting uncomfortably, as our primal instincts told us we must tend to this pain, and save the baby.
Some even spoke out in ceremony not able to hold their tongues any longer.
I myself started counting the minutes, that we might have to endure it, and then there was silence.
This silence proved to increase the primal tension.
Was the baby ok?
Did it pass out, how could it suddenly be so still, how would we know in this darkness that the child was still all right?
The seconds ticked by even longer as the priest poured out more song, and more water for steam.
Finally we were released from this hell, and the baby cried once again as the door flap was ordered open.
It didnt come right away, and we were again forced to wait against everyones will this time.
Did they forget about us, did they all go back to the house because of the rain?
No, finally some one took mercy on us, and the door flew back.
Some of us stayed collapsed as the heat rolled out and the cool fresh air poured in.
I crawled out around some of the bodies and around the circle of steaming stones.
I literally kissed the earth and staggered to me feet.
I saw S and she was the one to have stayed behind for us.
I kidded her saying she was our Valkyrie come to retake our souls from their voyage.
We gathered around the fire, and I stood the longest in the rain with only my towel around me, so disoriented, and not being able to gage my own body temperature.
I slipped and fell, cutting my hand as I struggled to put on my robe.
The grey haired old professor, was now back after having found his missing friend who had been wandering the woods and the highway after the medicine lodge.
She spoke only French and the group had been very concerned for her.
Now, relieved, it was his turn to smoke his pipe, and he invited us to do so.
We all hugged and rejoiced in our new lives.
Our native guide held out his wet trunks over the fire to dry on a stick, as if he were waving a victory flag.
Later of course, we retired to the house, were I again gave thanks for indoor plumbing, and even though I couldnt hold any food down I was thankful to purge myself of those toxins still coursing through me.
Most of us tried to eat some thing, and the dinner from the night before, that again greeted us with pies, soups, and deserts, no longer had their allure.
All I could stand was liquid and a few bites of salad and bread.
It was a good experience, and brought about a lot of introspection.

I just would like to first talk about this sacred plant of the Peyote, and mescaline one of the sacred chemicals in the plant, which I believe should all be consumed in the natural form and taken by itself to humble ourselves to the divine medicine.
I have been taking this sacred medicine now for two years.
Let me tell the you I've been searching all my life for many things that I cannot explain and now I believe I have found it.
I got involved with Drugs at age 21 with my ex we started to use Marijuana, then I got into MDMA, I became very addicted to ecstacy and could not stop.
I then knew of the Native American Medicine men who would conduct sacred ceremonies in Tee Pee's which would take place as all night prayer rituals including the usage of the Sacred Tobacco, and we would all be in a circle around the fire, the fire was in the center of the teepee, then next to the fire was the holy altar.
The Medicine man gave me a total of 8 buttons during the night and then we prayed all night singing and speaking our mind the teachings that came from our elders.
I had visions, beautiful ones, I was able to speak to the peyote, ask it to heal me, I asked for blessings to me and many others.
I saw a whole new world I was able to connect to the universe, I saw in the sky many Native american Designs like the ones you would see on Hopi Kathinas or in many pueblo arts and pottery also many Meso american Designs and I was taken to a world where there was colorful cactus everywhere.
I then saw, the constant movement of the universe and a web this interconnects us to every object, every prayer and every feeling idea.
I was able to see the many spirits that are in our lives at every time I even saw the Web/internet being another example of this web.
I saw issues in my life and noticed I faced all my fears each time I did that I noticed I would get sick and then it would all come out.
Sometimes instead of puking I would just burp or fart.
Near the end I would just see bright colors and my mind slowed down and my thought process was back to normal.
After this experience I had quit all drugs except the natural medicines in nature.
I now have good things and good people in my life, I still to this day continue to go to the ceremonies and I now want to go to mexico and south america to experience the Medicines including Mushrooms and Ayahuasca.
That is all for now I hope you all can get something good out of the usage of peyote and mushrooms respect them and use it all for a purpose and to heal.

Nestled in a secluded, high southwestern desert valley, there exists a quasi-legal, all-race peyote-using church.
I say quasi-legal because protection for growing its sacrament, peyote, is by state statute alone, not Federal law.
Officially formed in the late seventies, the church has thrived for many years fighting for all-race religious peyote use.
Based upon the tenets of the Native American Church and fused with some of the doctrines of Mormonism, the church teaches love, holiness and a respect for nature that is literally awesome to behold firsthand.
As I arrived at this seemingly barren location late one afternoon, I wondered what I would encounter in such a brutally hot desert locale.
I was not disappointed.
All I can say of the weekend experience is that it all finally made sense to me.
Greeted at the door by the original founder of the church, I was received with open arms and immediately felt the love of my hosts.
I was given a brief tour of the humble premises and was then shown the Peyote House where over 1,000 peyote cactuses were growing.
One of the apostles proudly displayed a collection of illegal sacred plants.
I asked how the church could operate such an openly illegal practice given the strict Federal laws regarding the growing and harvesting of peyote, at which she replied that their state and the surrounding community have taken great pains to protect religious freedom.
Being a predominant Mormon community, the area has had its fair share of religious disputes with the Federal government in regard to religious freedom.
For the most part though, the Federal government has turned a blind eye to the religious practice of growing peyote for religious purposes.
After settling down and setting up my tent on their land, I was awed by the beauty of nature that surrounded me.
The desert was teeming with life and a home nearby was decorated in colorful pottery, which supports the financial aspect of the church.
Leaders of the church spend hours working on the pottery and seem to pass the time peacefully in intelligent conversation.
It is solely up to these individuals to decide whether or not one is worthy, so to speak, of partaking of the holy sacrament.
Upon my arrival, I can honestly say that I did not know whether or not I truly wanted to participate in their sacrament or whether I was prepared for the experience.
This said, my first test, it seemed, was with the founder of the church.
He is a kind and gentle 25% Native American man who asked where I came from and the purpose of my visit.
We spent time in rocking chairs while he introduced me to all of the pets and the wildlife that regularly visited the window of the house.
He told stories of his military service in World War II and unselfishly imparted his words of wisdom upon me about the meaning of life, the history of his legal troubles, and his fight for all-race peyote use.
Though he is a dedicated servant to the church, I felt no pressure from him to comprehend the complexities involved in using peyote and I was unsure of what he thought of my responses to his many questions.
One thing I did know for sure, this man had religious and social convictions that were on par with any man I have ever met.
My apparent test continued through the night and into the next morning while I had pleasant conversations with other leaders of the church as they told me how they met the churchs founder and how they were able to obtain and sustain such a great quantity of peyote.
They mentioned their love and respect for their Mormon neighbors, who have paradoxically been some of the most ardent protectors of their religious freedom in the area, although Mormonism in no way advocates their use of the controlled substance.
I began a fast in the morning at the recommendation of one of the apostles and spent my time hiking and exploring the wonders of the desert location.
I love the mountains and hike quite often, but nothing could prepare me for what would happen that night.
I assume I passed their test of sincerity since I was soon to be given a peyote tea.
I was honored at this gesture and listened intently as the apostles explained what to expect, if anything.
Again, I was not disappointed, for that night was the night I saw the stars dance.
The peyote sacrament was prepared in a tea, and I was also given two dried capsules of peyote to help enhance my experience with the medicine. I signed some legal papers reporting that my use of the substance was for purely religious purposes and off to the desert I was sent for what is called The Spirit Walk. Unlike the structure and ritual of the NAC peyote ceremony, The Spirit Walk is a solitary journey that the churchs founder reminded me was the key to finding out the answers to difficult questions.
The leaders disdain for the rigidity and structure of organized religions was painfully transparent, and for the first time, soon before I began my walk, I think he actually preached as a Christian zealot that he believed this was the only way one could come to understand what The Peyote Way, what life in general, was all about.
I retired to my tent slowing ingesting the most disgustingly bitter tea of my life.
As I relaxed on a lawn chair, literally in the middle of nowhere, I awaited the effects of the psychoactive substance in peyote, mescaline, to take effect.
Ever so slowly, my body began to feel warm and intensely uncomfortable.
A small buzz arose in my ears and it culminated in what seemed like the vomiting of the entire tea that I consumed over the space of about an hour.
I swallowed the peyote capsules given to me with a splash of water, and slowly but surely, everything finally made sense!
All the years of my research and reading began to unfold before my eyes.
The Is-ness of Huxley, the tune in of Leary, the set and setting of Smith all fell into place as I watched the moon begin to brighten with an intense array of color.
The trees and the ground below me were infused with what I can only describe as life. Their colors, though it was now well past dark, were a heightened green and brown with spots of red, blue and yellow.
As I looked up into the beautiful night sky, I noticed that my mouth had been wide open in awe for quite some time because my throat, lips and mouth were entirely parched.
I soon became consciously aware of why this was the case: I was watching the stars dance.
I understood now why Huxley had such a hard time describing his mescaline experience in words within his book Doors of Perception.
I understood why the set and setting so ardently defended by Huston Smith played such an important role in this experience.
My mind was entirely preoccupied with what I would normally to have considered trivial.
The rocks on the ground exploded with color, the stars ebbed and flowed with the music I was listening to and I began to sing as loudly as possible.
An overwhelming sense of joy and even a sense of love infused my whole body.
So I started to laugh, very loudly.
I laughed so hard I began to cry.
My tears were not tears of sadness or of pain, but of a giddy and even childish joy at all that was occurring to me.
My body seemed to melt into the lawn chair and I felt as if I was part and parcel of everything around me.
Then came Huxleys infamous heaven and hell experience.
Huxley wrote another book soon after Doors of Perception about his mescaline experiences in which he describes something similar to R. Gordon Wasson calls Ecstasy. However, as Wasson reports, ..ecstasy is not fun.
Your very soul is seized and shaken until it tingles. I was so overtaken by the visual sensations that I was experiencing I retired inside my tent for a while.
What awaited me was the hell and a sense of guilt and horror at all of the things I had taken for granted in my life.
I reflected on the words of the church founder when he said you can learn more by following the path of the fly than the words of a preacher.
I believe this simple phrase was meant to remind me that we are all somehow metaphysically connected to everything around us and no preacher can teach us the sublime nature of such a doctrine.
Although the preacher may be able to tell a person of the ontological importance of such doctrine, to actually follow the path of the fly, aided by the peyote experience, give a direct personal contact to what the preacher can only talk about.
I could not tell if I was talking to God or not, but what was happening to me felt like a direct experience of something divine.
Though reminded of my imperfections, I was imbued with a renewed sense and desire to overcome my imperfections and to somehow make them right.
The beauty all around me was evidence enough to convince me that I had to do something different with my life and to perceive the world in a better light.
I had to change some things and become a better father, husband and person.
I finally understood why there was such an overwhelming respect for this cactus and why it leads many Native Americans (and others) to shun alcohol use and other intoxicating substances.
In everything, I saw... goodness, and I inexplicably felt I was part of that goodness.
By this time I had lost all sense of time and sleep escaped me.
I returned outside (admittedly a little disoriented) to see my dancing stars and started a small fire, which is recommended by the clergy of the church if conditions are favorable.
I gleefully watched for what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes as the smoke and fire dwindled into the most beautiful embers of fading light.
I noticed that the mescaline was finally starting to wear off because my stars began to be fixed in their places, and I succumbed to my fatigue and fell into a blissful rest.
So what does this story have to do with harm?
Well, nobody was harmed by the use of peyote except for my family who had to endure my being gone on a three day long trip to the desert.
The right set and setting aided me in finding out some crucial information about an illegal substance revered by many a portion of the divine substance. The fact that I felt a part of that divine presence evoked a pleasure that I shared with my host the next morning.
As I broke my fast that morning with oranges, grapes and nectarines, I savored the sweetness of each bite.
In contrast to the bitter peyote, I found that even a piece of gum was immensely tasteful.
I conversed with the church founder about my experience and he again showed no signs of pushing the importance of the religious use of peyote.
His only concern was that I learned from the personal, solitary experience and that I let no other interpret what I had felt and seen.
In regard to that last sentence, I honestly do not know how to interpret what I felt and saw.
I admit that years of research did make a lot of sense to me after ingesting peyote, but I am still at a loss to describe what happened to me.
The naturalist/physicalist in me wants to explain away the experience by an appeal to the scientific evidence of how mescaline affects brain function.
My religious leanings point to a holy and sacred experience that I share with the reader in story form, hopefully with reverence.
I do not know if I will ever take a hallucinogenic substance ever again.
It is not that I am presumptuous enough to claim I have learned or experienced all there is to know about these experiences, but quoting Alan Watts, When you get the message, hang up the phone.  For now I have received enough of the message concerning the religious and recreational use of hallucinogens.
I respect the fact that others consider these substances sacred and holy or even just pleasurable and I share my peyote experience only to show that their religious use can and ought to be protected.
Although I am just as honest in defending that given the right set and setting, the hallucinogens recreational use seems to be as benign and harmless as their religious use.
Hallucinogenic substances do appear to be a boon that with the right kinds of controls and education could be used to benefit many a person.
I just hope that my story helps relay the importance of more protection for our beloved nations liberties in regard to hallucinogenic drug use.

At the begining, right when it touches my mouth, I immedeately start to feel different.
I don't eat all 24-26 buttons at once, I I start out with about 2 fresh buttons that I chewed, they were cleaned (the Fuzz or Hairs were removed), then right after I ate about 4 teaspoonfuls of very dry finely grounded powder, then came the mush about another 4 teaspoonfuls, then throughout the night they will pass the peyote around and I came up with about 24-26 buttons but probably more like 30-34 buttons.
This is a very high dosage, I eat this plant quite often just about 2 times per month for the past 10 years sometimes I eat it every weekend for months straight.
Within the first 10-20 mins, I can feel my stomache start to ache, I start to belch a lot.
Slowly I start to feel the effects.
20-60 mins later, I start noticing that all light and objects seem to be more intense.
Everything starts to look sharp and bright.
1 Hour to 2 hours, I start to feel a lot of nausea, but I don't feel like puking, I probably would have if I would have made any sudden moves, I start noticing my thoughts start to move around more and they start to come alive, when I close my eyes I start to see blue, orange, Green, and red designs that are very brightly colored.
The designs that I start to see are very geometrical, and I start to even see the designs starting to form people and objects along with other things.
I can't keep my eyes open at this point as I can't keep my eyes in one place they start moving a lot, and I prefer to close in case they start to roll back and I start to freak out people.
Suddenly I start to go into some deep dream states, it's as if I'm having lucid dreams, they last very short seconds maybe just a second but a lot happens.
I start seeing other people's thoughts expressed to me in the form of dreams, I see intricate details of people, things that they only know.
I start hearing people talk to me in the dreams.
I start flying to the universe and I see bright bright colors now, the designs move slowly and not fast contantly changing like mushrooms do to me.
I see colored lights pass over me as if I'm flying in the universe filled with bright stars.
I suddenly find myself in a world where everything is crystal, and I see holy beings that look like Hopi Kachinas and a mixture of Northwestern totem poles a long with a japanese feel.
I start to receive info about my life and how to become a better person, I learn ways on how to be in life, humble, loving.
How to pray better, how to heal, how to find a better job, right decisions.
I moved around into different worlds and different thoughts.
Now 3-4 hours I've eaten the rest of the peyote, at this point i'm very nauseas and can't move much, I feel heavy and I see a lot of things now, I feel very emotional, and I feel like I want to stand up, but I can't, I still feel a lot of peyote in my stomache and I'm belching a lot now.
I now get the guts to walk around, the clouds are moving fast and I see bright colors everywhere.
Symbols, I start to hear a vibration, and I hear things in a different language, my thoughts sound like a different language, it's like a code, and I start to understand it clear, I learn the most beautiful things and some very bizarre understandings that make so much sense but there are no words to express this spiritual connection, but I've understood it quickly, I know that these teachings are a part of me even though I forget after this dosage.
I don't feel safe walking alone so I go back in the teepee and feel good.
I feel so happy, I can't take off this smile, I continue to feel like this, I see designs of many things.
Six hours later the nausea is almost gone but it comes in waves.
The peyote is still working on me very strong, 10-12 hours later I feel fine, still feel good and the effects slowly will go away.
I feel like a new person, I feel good alive and get this, days later I got what I asked the peyote to help me get.
The peyote told me it would be 4 days, and I got exactly four days later...what a good blessing.
I do not recommend this dosage, however I feel most people can't OD because one would most likely puke before they OD.
Be careful with this though it would never hurt ya, but can be quite scare if used incorrectly.
I would recommend not to mix with anything because it is such a potent healing medicine.

A best friend of mine is full native american.
His mother was an experienced shaman and used peyote as part of her religion to induce visions that had value to her dogma.
For years, me and her son had tried to persuade her to let us try her sacred drink but she would always modestly turn us down.
Telling her son that he was not mentally mature enough to handle it and telling me that I was white and would not understand nor enjoy the experience.
One day when we were both 18, my best friend and I decided to spent part of the evening toking some homegrown northern lights he had been growing.
The normal and familiar intoxication followed.
We continuously laughed and made jokes over issues.
This followed some weight lifting, video games(tony hawk), sparring (were both skilled in martial arts), and an evening walk.
Later we returned home to finish the stash and probably go out and hit up the strip.
We packed the bong and took several tokes before his door swung open.
CAUGHT!
His mother, the only parent living with him, came in and sat across from him.
He had moved the bong behind him and was hiding the remains of the weed in his closed fist.
'What's are you hiding?
' his mother asked, raising an eyebrow.
It was obvious at this point we were both incredibly stoned.
Her eyes darted at me, and back at him.
As always while under the influence of marijuana, I am able to perceive body language much better.
'Jonathan, let me see it, I'm going to smoke some too.
' she spoke.
Me and Jonathan looked at each other and burst into uncontrolled laughter.
'No way mom!
' 

'OK, but you have to let me and Tim in on that tea.
' Her eyes spaced out for a second, her face completely calm and confident, giving nothing away.
Then she nodded.
'Fair enough.
'

Jonathan reveals to her the large bong hidden behind him, already packed.
She takes a very large toke and clears the whole bullpiece and stares ahead, her face expressionless, then she blows the whole cloud of smoke out without coughing.
Needless to say, me and Jon were impressed.
She then disappeared into her room, locked her door, and emerged about 1/2 hour later with 2 large wooden cups with colorful designs.
She beckoned us into the living room.
We sat, candles lit across the dim room.
She raised the cup to her mouth and breathed into it, but in a controlled burst, making hissing noises into the fluid.
She then spoke in her native language as if blessing the drink and handed one to me.
Doing the same with the next, and handing it to Jonathan.
We both gulped the disgusting tasting fluid down quickly, almost gagging.
She took our cups and stood.
'You must be left in solitude to fully learn the plant.
' With this, she retires to her room.
We sat there, waiting for something to happen, not sure what to think.
Somewhere along the way I have fallen asleep.
I have no dreams, only inky blackness, and deep, undisturbed sleep.
I wake in cold sweat.
Jonathan has just gotten up and ran to the bathroom.
He's very loud at this point, yelling out profanity.
I'm still in the haze of my sleep, not really catching all he's saying.
I look at the clock, and we've been asleep for about 2 hours.
The candles across the room seem to dance and sway, but I'm not paying attention, I jump to my feet and follow Jonathan down the hall.
I can hear him in his bathroom, vomiting.
Before I can even make it to the bathroom, something has hit me.
I look at the door at the end of the hall.
It burst wildly out of control and spins to the left to the right, almost like its a top, but never fully completing a 180 degree turn.
It seems like its charging toward me, swaying back and forth.
My heart skips a beat and I instinctively raise my hands in a classic Karate stance as if to fight it off.
I can see my fist in front of me, and yet they looked so foreign.
My hands seem to expand and swell, as if made of some type of liquid.
Then they dissolve and melt into bright colors, hues of blue and green, mostly blue.
'What is it?
' I say out loud.
'I can't...
I can't... it's too much.
' I manage to gasp out.
I immediately felt like I had gone in way too over my head.
I felt like I felt the sense of deja-vu when I had once been talked into riding the scariest roller coaster at Busch Gardens, and once I was on it, I became so frightened, that I wanted it to end.
This was exactly how I felt right now and things got worse.
I could still hear Jonathan in the bathroom, mumbling and rambling random words.
I knew he was in the same world I was.
Yet I felt a million miles away from him, stuck in my own dilemma, fighting my own demons.
I turned and made my way to the door and lay in the center of the floor.
The light fixture overhead turned into a large, insectoid looking structure before my eyes that hovered over me.
I was terrified.
'No...
no!
' I screamed.
The creature then seemed to speak to me, breaking away into a jewel like structure, moving in a clockwise-wise pattern.
Each wave making weird noise I can't describe in words.
I curled myself into a ball and buried my face deep within the fibers of the carpet, only to be immersed in the world of the most insane closed eyed visuals I'd ever seen.
I've done extremely high doses of shrooms, eating a 1/2 oz before, 800 mgs of dxm, as well as several salvia experiences, and yet nothing was like this.
It was out of this world.
I was traveling down a blue lit path, through space.
I was being sucked into a black hole.
Slowly as I grew closer to the black ominous object, the figures of Orion swirled and waved around it.
I was getting closer.
As I got closer, everything split into two, separated by the intense gravitational pull.
I was flung at light speed through the event horizon, where all the light circled in a cone shape, unable to escape the pull.
I was spinning, very quickly, faster than I could imagine, in a world of lights and colors.
Into the singularity, into the singularity, which was a the realm of the unknown.
I opened my eyes and ran out the front door, and puked in the front lawn.
I immediately felt better.
It was quiet, and for a second or two, the visions stopped.
Then they started up again, gentler, milder this time, and more euphoric.
The blades of the grass rose and circled around me, moving, very much alive.
Bright yellows flowers from her garden, slowly hued over to blue and extended their petals, creating snakes flowing from the center of the flower, which became a flux of geometrical creation.
It was no longer frightening, it was beautiful, completely beautiful.
The geometry became vines, tongues, and swirls of rainbow colors.
'WOW' I managed.
I turned my head, to view the whole quiet suburban street and everything was swept away by light and colors.
I looked up at the sky, and the stars shone down, only to travel to the center and create an orb in the sky that I perceived as god.
The orb separated into halos of geometry, that extended further and further away in waves until they made up the whole sky.
All moving in a beautiful sea of religous geometrical shapes.
First making the star of david, then a cross, and expanding away into snakes.
The snakes were all around me now.
One curled around my body and eyeballed me for a few seconds with non hostile eyes, it then curled and spun away, my eyes following it, watching it absorb the whole world into a flash of brilliant colors.
I cant remember how long I stood outside, remarked by nature.
It must have been hours, just standing in one spot, blown away by the visions and the animality and signifigance of each.
I had returned into the house to find Jonathan sitting on his bed, his mother sitting next to him.
I was still hallucinating heavily at this point, and my body still felt heavy, yet undefinably free.
I felt like I was expanding and becoming part of my vision, its totally hard to describe in words.
Jonathan was talking of his visions.
I looked at the clock, yet could not see the letters, whenever I almost got a good glance at the lettering, they dissolved into particles and were lost in the fabric of time.
'The time...?
' I spoke out loud.
'3:30, your experience is almost over.
'

Slowly the visions became more and more subtle, consisting of only changes and colors of Jonathan's face.
His mother had left the room, and we talked of our visions.
I told him of the beautiful snakes and colors I had seen outside.
He said he saw skeletons.
He said he saw his own body as a skeleton with no flesh.
He talked of horrifying visions of hell of insects crawling across his floor, the scariest being a scorpion with a large stinger.
We spent the whole remaining of the late night talking of our visions and our enlightenment from each till morning.
To this day, I still have a strong belief that peyote is a gateway into an invisible world, that is unseen and not understood by the naked eye and the sober mind.
Everything around us, a rock, a blade of grass, contains a spirit, and a consciousness.
Since then, I have an undeniable newfound respect for life of plants and animals.
I long to repeat the experience again.

'The kingdom of Heaven exists inside us and all around us, not in buildings of wood or stone.
Split wood, and I am there.
Lift a rock, and I am there.
' This means much to one who has walked in harmony with the land and sky.
One who has seen the Great Spirit shine through the sun and stars and whisper with the wind.
One who does not need a church to define his faith.
Who only needs the simple wonders of the world to know and to love his God.
The flesh of God is here.
On this lonely prairie, under a canopy of brilliant stars and silent mesquite trees.
Their is an unspoken, ancient wisdom here.
A stillness which conjures awe and reverence in this weary soul of mine.
Shhhh.
Be still O sick one, and watch the world.
Grasp the light before it fades into eternal darkness.
Find your own answers here.
Become one with mescalito.....
So it was that we walked the dirt pathway to self discovery.
My friend and I set out, in that foul year of our Lord, 2005, to find the mystical and elusive cactus, Peyote.
To the natives, at least some of them, it is considered the flesh of the Great Spirit.
A plant which puts our feeble human spirits in tune with the vibrations of an alternate dimension.
A slacker's channel to truth, peace, and understanding.
Its a crying shame that something so beautiful has been outlawed.
They will burn eternally for that one.
But anyway, since we could not legally purchase this rare and exciting experience, we set out into the desert of southwestern Texas in hopes that peyote would find us there.
With us we carried all the necessary supplies, bedrolls, meditation books, sauce pan, large sack of marijuana, lighter, pipe, papers, rolling tobacco, lots of water, roast beef sandwiches, lemons, and open minds.
We hitchhiked from Austin down to Zapata county, where we began our trek.
The sun was hot and unforgiving, but the mary jane helped ease the pain.
The first day there was no luck at all, so we bedded down and ate a sandwich a piece, drank a bottle of water, smoked a bowl, and crashed.
Next morning I awoke early and decided to take a brisk stroll.
I found a little ledge and sat up on it looking into the East at the rising sun.
There I began to deeply meditate and speak silently to God.
I requested that we find our vision and out truth on this journey, whatever it may be.
After about an hour of meditation and reflection, I began to make my way back to camp.
Then, lo and behold, I saw the flesh of God.
A small patch of peyote tucked perfectly away under a large mesquite bush.
I sank to my knees and sat in silent awe, for my prayer had been answered.
I walked happily into camp, waking my friend and surprising him with six fresh picked buttons.
We then split half a sandwich and began to boil some water over an open flame.
We then chopped up the peyote and threw it in with some lemon juice.
We let this boil down, adding water every now and then, for about 2.5 to 3 hours, smoking joints and chatting while we waited.
When we judged that it had been cooking long enough, we took it off and sifted out the leftover crap and ended up with some thick, dark green, slimy looking liquid.
We choked it down and then put ourselves into a state of preparation.
The first thing that comes with peyote is extreme nausea and discomfort.
It is as if I must undergo pain to find pleasure.
Nothing truthly good comes without a price.
After about 20 or 30 minutes I threw up for all I was worth.
Yuck, what utterly rancid stuff.
But its worth it.
After I hurled I felt much better and decided to go on a little walk.
My friend was still in the process of being totally sick so I left him behind for awhile.
Thus my adventure began.
At first there was this inexplicable sense of oneness with all that surrounded me.
I delighted in every living thing I saw, and could almost see this white, buzzing energy that permeated throughout all life forms.
Wild animals I would normally never see began to appear.
And whats more interesting is that they seemed to have to fear of me whatsoever.
They would come within spitting distance and just silently looking at me, speaking to me in a language mankind has forgotten how to speak.
I still do not know if these creatures were hallucinations or reality, but I believe they were real.
After about an hour of walking, I found myself back at camp where my friend was sitting indian style and smoking a large bowl of tobacco out of our hand crafted peace pipe.
I sat next to him and he gravely passed the pipe my way.
I accepted, and we sat silently for awhile.
We both swear that we communicated without spoken words that day.
After some time we split ways again, under the assumption that every individual must find their own vision.
So we set out on our vision quests and found startling truths about ourselves that we never knew.
I was walking along when I noticed the mesquite brush had molded together and now appeared to be lightly waving water.
I was in the desert, surrounded by a green ocean.
This is when I believe God appeared to me.
I was standing there, and then I looked up at the sun.
I was momentarily blinded and when my vision returned there was a white glow to the land.
Standing before me in a great blaze of fire was a buffalo.
But this was no ordinary buffalo.
This buffalo had the face of a lion and the wings of an eagle.
Its coat was as white as new fallen snow and its eyes burned like hot coals.
It was the single most amazing thing I have ever seen.
But more amazing still was that when our eyes locked, for one instant, I saw all of my wrongs and all of the wrongs of my ancestors, and I saw the path to righteousness and the path to evil.
I saw the light and the dark and knew that I had the power to choose my destiny.
I saw the truth.
And then the great beast turned, and, in the blink of an eye, was gone.
Flew back into the heavens and the earth, and back into all things big or small, where it would reside in peace forever.
The rest of my experience was inconsequential, and my time has run short for writing this, so I must close.

It was a nice Saturday evening in late June.
Stashed away in my room were 8 peyote buttons and 1/8 ounce of mushrooms, all of which was to be split between my friend Bryan and me.
This would be my second time with mushrooms, but the peyote was foreign to me and I was to take both along with smoking a hefty sum of cannabis.
The first time I took mushrooms it was 1/16 of an ounce, the same amount taken on this trip.
I saw mild hallucinations, including the infamous shifting floor, but I thought they were just that, hallucinations.
This trip proved more to be just a trip, it turned out to be an eye opener to whats really floating around out there.
[6:00 pm] We ingested the peyote, which I grounded up the best I could so it would metabolize faster.
The peyote had too much of a barky texture that couldnt be pulverized into powder with a pestle and mortar.
The small pieces were much too bitter to chew up so I had to swallow mine down with water.
Bryan had to eat his with pizza because he couldnt even handle swallowing it with water.
We planned to trip hard during the late hours and took it early so for two reasons: One was upon hearing peyote takes really long to kick in and the other was if it made us vomit, we would still have shrooms to look forward to.
[9:45 pm]Four hours later and I had only felt a head change, which had been an hour before.
We had practically given our hopes up in the thought that peyote was doing nothing to us.
We smoked a bowl at the park and took the mushrooms.
Then we walked over to another park, which I had bad feelings about.
All these bright baseball lights were on from a little league game so I felt a little more comfortable.
After a cigarette, Bryan wanted to smoke more weed.
I didnt want to because I knew it would make me paranoid, but I ended up doing so anyway.
This park is a hot zone for pigs so we walked toward the wooded area of the park to get away from the baseball field lights.
Right then, the lights shut off and we were in darkness.
Paranoia surged though my veins and my heart rate increased.
We immediately walked back toward a bathroom with a dim light to smoke by.
We smoked two bowls, which literally took forever.
All the time while I was smoking, my mind was set on just getting home.
[10:45 pm]I was a hopeless paranoid at that moment.
We walked into dairy queen for a couple of waters.
Right then I felt drugs beginning to take hold.
The room began glow and pulse.
I had a very hard time ordering a simple free water.
Once we left I knew I was in a pickle.
My mom usually expects me home around 11:00.
I looked way too high to confront her with my droopy dark dilated eyes, I also knew that it was only going to get worse from here on out.
Our best bet was to go home before it got worse.
[11:15 pm]I arrived home.
Lucky for me, my mom was in bed reading.
I quickly locked the door, said goodnight to my mom and went to my room with Bryan before she could even see me.
It was a big relief for me and the fear slowly began to settle.
My room looked the same as it did the first time I did shrooms.
It was glowing a bright haze and the geometric patterns were shifting on my floor.
Something wasnt right though.
Everything just seemed to be overloaded.
I wasnt tripped out, there was just this feeling I had that there was too much shit going on and I couldnt comprehend what it was or why I felt this way.
Being at the park just triggered a switch for what I thought would be an all night bad trip.
[11:30 pm]Only fifteen minutes had gone by and it felt like it had been two hours.
The peyote and mushrooms suddenly worked together to kick me in the nuts with full force.
I went from mild paranoid feelings, to a full force of paranoia and bad vibes.
I knew I could make it pass with complete silence and tranquility in my room for about ten minutes.
That was not the case.
Bryan kept moving about the room, talking too much and wanted me to get food for him.
I kept explaining to him over and over to stop talking, stop moving around the room, and stop asking me for things.
It fell upon deaf ears.
He can be completely worthless when he is under the influence sometimes.
My bad energy was on a meter in the negative side that was very slowly drifting toward the positive side.
Every time Bryan said or did anything, it would jerk me back further down the negative side.
Once I reached the positive side of the meter, I wouldnt go back to the negative side.
Bryan was not allowing this to happen.
[12:00 am - Lost time in the space time continuum - 5:00am ]Bryan finally stopped after a half hour of me constantly pestering him.
I sat quietly in my chair slouched over with my head in my hands.
The overload of thoughts and randomness began to settle faster then I expected.
The mood of my room started to change and became very comforting.
The same geometric patterns were still shifting on my floor, but they werent a bother.
I looked over at Bryan and we both knew by each others stare that were somehow in the same state of perception.
We proceeded to zone out in trances for several minutes.
We were interrupted by Bryans cell ringing so I went to the bathroom, sat on the toilet, and watched the floor shift around.
Noises started to run through my head.
The shag rug on the floor began to sway back and forth to an aquatic fantasy melody, which gave off strong vibes of being underwater.
There was also a faint conversation going on between two people.
I left to go back to my bedroom and Bryan had the look of oblivion.
Everything was strange yet manageable.
We decided to have a nice bowl or two.
--This is where my entire perception on the essential nature of a trip completely altered--

After two bowls, shit got intense.
I wasnt scared, but I knew something was going on in my room other than illusion.
The noises in my head grew louder.
Bryan had the I dont know look upon his face, so I turned off all the lights except a dim blue fish lamp (so things couldnt get too scary) and began talking with him.
Are you hearing voices? I asked.
I dont know.
I.I really justdont know how to explain whats going on, he replied.
Wait, just be quiet and listen.

So we listened in silence and sure enough noises started to emerge.
The voices werent clear and I could only repeat the tone.
As I started repeating the first things I heard, Bryan looked at me in shock.
No fuckin way he said.
We kept listening and took turns repeating what we heard.
The noises ranged from little girls laughing to conversations to tunes and knocking.
There was too much going on to explain it all.
Then a jumble of images began to appear in my head.
The first thing that appeared was a row of water wheels.
I asked Bryan what he saw and it was the same thing.
We than closed our eyes and began telling each other what we saw.
Christ, things got really crazy at this point.
All these images of multi-colored patters, places and tunnels began to appear.
Bryan and I continued to describe the things that we saw simultaneously.
There was even Da Vincis Vitruvian Man holding Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon prism.
What did all of this stuff mean?
I had no clue but I wanted more.
We decided to go a little deeper with another bowl.
While smoking, noises became louder.
At one point while holding in a hit, I heard someone coughingright after that I coughed my lungs out.
I knew one of those bastards somehow knew I was going to cough and mocked me for it.
After that bowl, something happened that I DID NOT expect.
I could now feel what was going on.
The room began to glow very bright, then dim down.
It seemed like these waves of energy were coming in from one corner and leaving the other.
As they came in my body temperature would rise accompanied by tingly burning sensations.
The vibes in my room constantly changed from positive to negative.
As the energy shifted, my body temperature shifted back and forth from cold shivers to burning hot.
At one point it felt like my body was completely covered in IcyHot.
Crazy?
Yes, but the fact that Bryan was all the while feeling the very same thing is even crazier.
An unknown while later, I began to come down.
Wrong!
When I just got done cursing in disappointment, my room turned gray and there were little Tiki savages dancing on my closet door.
The trip continued forward for the rest of the night constantly shifting in moods without affecting my own.
My conclusion on my fraudulent comedown is that not too many things from the other side happened to be passing though at that moment.
This happened to me before with another friend on a DXM trip.
We just seemed to abruptly come down at the same time.
I didnt know what to think of it then, but after this trip I knew why.
Another conclusion Ive come to about my room is that its a spiritual portal, more so than other places in my house.
My closet is the worst.
My same friend, who I abruptly came down off of DXM with, said he kicked a giant stone soldier that was coming out of the closet during a different DXM trip.
He also said there were skeletons constantly peeking out and whenever hed look over, theyd quickly hide.
I laughed at the whole thing and thought he was just trippin hard.
During another time he was over, we smoked salvia and he said the giant stone bastard had came back.
Not to worry, he said, I crushed him into a little ball and lit him on fire. What a fucking nutcase, a nutcase who saw something I couldnt up until the night of this experience.
When Bryan told me we needed to close my closet door, I knew that my other friend was right about a stone soldier trying to get him.
My closet has some very bad vibrations coming out of it.
Its probable that all the noir ambience appearing that night came out of my closet.
Chills ran up my spine and a strong sense of something angry watching me was present when I opened the door.
That door remained closed for the rest of the night and continues to stay closed at nighttime to this day.
Typical children who are scared of the so-called boogeyman in the closet may be damn well scared for a reasonsomething I had no understanding of before, even though I experienced some of these same troubles as a youth.
The trip finally wore off somewhere around 5:00 am when Bryan had enough of it all and went to sleep.
I decided to take my mind off all the shit with a little TV.
My head eventually straightened out and I was able to fall asleep around 6:00am, but not before receiving a final message (end of report).
It was my most insightful trip to date, and I plan on having many more.
Conclusion:

We saw, heard, and yes, even felt the same of everything 100% of the time while inquiring each other about it.
These visions are not something that even two people spending their entire lives together could possibly imagine by coincidence.
The most occurring images were tunnels in all different sorts geometric shapes.
These patterns seem to be the main thing about every hallucinogenic experience.
I dont know what meaning they have, but they must have one.
Bryan and I were even able to coincide the color combinations of these patterns.
My most memorable visions were scenes from the 1800s and a clear image of an alien appearing on my wall.
The only way to explain the way I picked these visions up is though a sixth sense.
My senses (spirit, mind, body, whatever) just picked them up as if I was in a tour bus along for a ride into an unexplored area.
There was no thought process whatsoever, it is just a matter of tuning in.
While tuned in, the images just appeared in my mind, similar to imagination but in a much different way.
The differences were the ability to scan around and clarity didnt change (as so in imaginations when trying to look at a big picture but unable to maintain smaller details used to build up that big picture)also, I was able to contemplate my own set conjectures on these visions with no affect to the visions themselves.
We all have a third eye and mine was opened that night.
The strange thing about this third eye is it ability to make itself present in all the worldly senses.
I believe that if one were to go deep enough, they could detect all that is around them with sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.
These hallucinogenic drugs definitely deserve more respect than what is given.
Sure, they can be used to just trip out which can very well produce desirable effects, however it is way more fun (considering the vibes are right) and beneficial to use it for enlightening religious and meditative purposes.
[A Prophecy?
: When I was watching TV, I turned to a news station (I think it was CNN).
On TV was some Mideastern leader talking about the death of the terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in the bombing attacks.
All of a sudden the sound tuned out.
A voice came over shouting, and I quote, al-Zarqawi isnt really dead, he is hiding, he is hiding from the true catastrophe that is about to happen. Then it seemed to click back to the original sound and someone elses voice was in the middle of a sentence.
This trip took place on June 24, 2006.
I dont know why it said al-Zarqawi was still alive seeing as how he was killed on June 6th, but I think the true catastrophe could relate to Israel-Lebanon-Hezbollah crisis that started on July 13th.
Was my mind fucking with me?
Was a prophecy spoken?
Or had some other force fucked with me?
Only time will answer these questions seeing as how this report was completed on August 4th 06 (a rather early point to be jumping to conclusions) and I cant update]

I am a male (vintage hippy) who has had a fair share of psychadelic experiences in my time.
None, however could equal up to the life-changing trip I experienced after ingesting 'the divine catus'.
It was saturday in El Paso,Texas.
I was out of the house by 6 o'clock looking for my well known friend, lysergic acid diethylamide.
Now up until this point I had never had a problem finding acid.
But this time would be different.
I was very dissapointed to hear that I had not succeeded in my journey for a dose.
That is, until I came across a mexican-american (let's call him Juan) that i had recenty jammed with.
I remember him telling me about a cactus he had experimented with while he was 'seeking enlightenment' in the chihuahan desert,mexico.
My curiosity arose.
Of course, being the desperate bastard i was at that point in time, I anxiously begged him to 'hook me up' with peyote.
(Now when I say hook-up, I'm not giving off the idea that I am a stoner who abuses psychoactive drugs for the feeling.
I have not, nor will I ever put a drug in my body for a reason other then to expand my mind, and for a better understanding of earth before it was infected by society.
) Juan informed me that I was in luck and a few of his friends actually did have peyote in their possession.
My dissapointment quickly turned to ecstatic joy.
'Hop in.
' Juan said.
I quickly jumped in the vintage 1971 volkswagen van.
And we were off.
Off for a religous experience i will never forget.....
When we arrived, I was surprised (but rather excited) to walk into an adobe-style house full of native americans.
They told me what to expect of the peyote, and that I would experience nausea.
(Especially being the size I am).
But they told me it was nothing compared to the knowledge I would gain from the trip.
Ok.
Enough of the novel bullshit.
Time for the good stuff.
They opened a bag about 3 feet high and probably 1 foot in diameter.
Inside was nearly 200 ready-to-serve peyote buttons.
They handed me 13 (which just heppens to be my lucky number).
They told me to be prepared for the bitter taste I would experience.
Man were they right.
I have never in my life tasted something so bitter.
But hey, you can't expect something that sprouts from the ground and stuck in a bag to taste like marshmallows.
I finished all 13 of them after about 30 minutes.
Probably an hour after ingestion, the nausea was extreme.
I went outside to vomit.
And vomit I did.
Goddamn did I vomit.
The negativity of the puking didnt compare to what was about to happen.
I walked around to the back of the house to see the mountains of El Paso (quite astonishing from certain angles).
And being that everyeone else was already tripping, I knew I wouldnt be missed greatly.
So off I was, to hike the mountains of Western Texas.
After about 30 miutes of hiking (the time now being about 10:30 P.M.), I stopped at my destination.
(That was whatever looked appealing to me.
) I layed down on my back.
The stars never had looked so beuatiful and in perfect order.
I stood up and looked around.
Everything was so incredibly fascinating and beautiful.
The shrub's leaves glistened with light.
It was at this time when I fell back down into an indian-style sitting position.
The intensity of the beauty grew every second.
Every time I blinked, A rainbow of colors appeared.
So I closed my eyes in a meditative style.
This is when my vision arose.
In this vision, I was standing still in a field looking straight ahead at a buffalo.
It was probably 50 yards away from me.
It moved forward slowly.
Probably an inch every minute or so.
The buffalo didnt move in position though when it came forward.
It just sort of slided towards me.
Now lets jump forward in time about an hour later when it is about 3 feet in front of me.
The past hour I had been so ammused by the buffalo coming towards me.
I was anticipating what would happen when it got to me.
Nearly a thousand thoughts were running through my head at once perfectly clear.
(I'm not sure exactly what they were now.
) But it seemed that every thought was how excited I was to see what would happen when the buffalo reached me.
Now let's skip to the part where the buffalo is 6 inches away from me.
The anticipation then turned to fear and terror.
It was coming head on towards my stomach.
It wasn't going to stop.
It was probably the most terrifying feeling I have ever experienced.
A few minutes later (roughly 5,000 thoughts later) It was centimeters away from my body.
If this were'nt a vision my pants would have been soaked with urine.
Here's the exciting part....
The buffalo is literally touching my skin, though i feel nothing, nor do I fall back.
It slowly just moves through my body.
Gliding right past me (well, through me).
A few minutes later, It is totally behind me, and all that I can see is the field and where it meets the horizon.
Now to end this vision, nothing could have done it better then what happens next.
At the start of the horizon A white light arises.
Then it suddenly grows to cover up my whole screen (meaning everything I can see/ everything in front of me) And just like that, I'm out of my visionary state, back in the mountains sitting just like I was before this happened.
Except, it was totally bright.
That vision I had which seemed to have taken place in about 2 hours had lasted about 10.
I looked around at everything I had admired the night before.
I say this in the simplest form, though no words can describe how I really felt...
I honestly felt ONE with everything around me, everything I saw.
And I have felt this way towards everything since this experience.
I walked back down to the indian's house.
And knocked on the door to find Juan saying, 'Hey man I'm ready to go.
' Just like that.
No 'hey where did you go, we were worried.
' Odd, but not offensive.
He took me back to my house, where I sat for the rest of the day wondering what all of my vision meant.
It surely couldn't have happened for no reason.
It had to have had a meaning.
And I was going to find out what that meaning was.
6 months later I had traveled with friends up to Oklahoma next to lawton, where the Wichita Mountains lie.
My friend and I were walking around.
Everything was well and peaceful.
Next thing we knew, a buffalo had gone wild and started running around at dangerous speeds in a psychotic manner.
My friend ran off in fear for his life.
But I on the other hand, was reminded of my vision on peyote.
The buffalo started running towards me.
In a matter of 10 seconds I had re-lived the 10 hour long experience that had occured.
And something in my mind had told me not to move.
When I snapped back into reality, the buffalo was standing right in front of me holding completely still.
It had gone from carelessly running around to standing completely still in a matter of seconds.
My friends was astonished.
As was I.
That is when I discovered what my vision meant.
And up to this date, that is the best experience I have ever encountered.
Definitely what i would call a spiritual experience.
I highly recommend the spiritual, medicinal, or religous use of Peyote to anyone seeking enlightenment.

Peyote






Nearly a decade ago, I first journeyed to Wirikuta, the sacred land of peyote.
The name Wirikuta has similar meaning for the Huichol people of Mexico as does our word heaven.
Members of this tribe have been ceremonially re-enacting the peyote 'hunt' for as long as they can trace their origins.
So it was that my interest in peyote and peyote people led me to this desolate, but magical desert valley.
Traveling to Mexico was definitely not in my plans that fall.
Work, finances, and family made it a pretty sure bet that any traveling I did would be done close to home.
Enter Prem Das, an American married into the Huichol tribe who at that time was based in Tepic, Nayarit.
He had originally contacted me by phone after reading an article in a popular magazine which I had provided information for.
The article had been about peyote and its legal use in Arizona.
Prem Das had been an avid student of peyote for several years.
He let me know that if I shared his interest, I should make my way to the sacred valley of the Huichol as the next step in my own relationship with the sacrament.
He listened patiently to all my reasons for staying home and being too busy to be bothered with spiritual travel adventures.
One day, while visiting my home, Prem Das pulled an airline ticket out of his bolsa.
(shoulder bag) It was my ticket to Puerto Vallarta, flying with him and his wife to go visit their Huichol family.
I was very happily surprised, but also disappointed with myself for knowing that I couldn't just pack up and hop on a plane within 48 hours, no matter how much I might like to.
Life was way too complicated, and I, way too previously occupied for that.
I politely declined his generous offer.
That night we attended a peyote ceremony co-hosted by myself and members of a local artisan community.
Prem Das was the roadman for the evening.
I mentioned to my artist acquaintances the airline ticket and my inability to accept it.
Out of friendship and the concern for Prem Das's wasted purchase, I asked my artist friend, Sharon, to travel to Mexico in my place.
She somewhat hesitantly agreed after hearing out my situation.
I had not however, counted on the working of the spirit of peyote...
The medicine was very strong that night.
During the peak of the ceremony, while my body sat apparently content, my inner being was in great turmoil.
I sensed my life as I knew it had reached its natural conclusion.
All my roads were leading nowhere.
Life for me, had become a charade.
The driving tone of the water drum and Prem Das's chanting, normally very comforting, now seemed to stir my pot of doubt and insecurity until I could feel my spirit boiling over and evaporating into emptiness.
Nothing in the world could at that moment have quenched my thirst for meaning, my hunger for purpose.
Nothing, that is, except the hand of God.
In my mind's eye I saw a weeping child (me) surrounded by empty space.
Into that loneliness, a white, silvery eagle suddenly appeared.
It swept down towards my vacant self, coming in for the kill, I thought.
After all, my life felt more corpse-like than alive.
As the sharp talons opened to grab its human prey, I suddenly felt the lifting of my self pity and perhaps even fear.
I was glad just to be able to let go and die in peace.
Unexpectedly, I began to feel the eagle warm and bless me rather than scattering my soul to the void.
A physical and spiritual blessing radiated from the eagle into my body, beginning where its formerly frightening talons now gently touched my head.
I felt the peace of heart and mind that only God's Spirit can bring.
Instantly, I realized that it had been too many years since I had fully bathed in God's healing light, too long running on my own knowledge and neglecting the daily blessings of Spirit.
I awoke from my vision with tears streaming down my face.
I looked across the fire as the drum beat on and saw my friend Sharon watching me, smiling.
I spent the rest of the night in meditative prayer, thanking God for the simple miracles of life.
In the morning, everyone who had participated in the ceremony visited with each other and shared some of their experience.
I sought out Sharon to thank her for standing in for me and accepting Prem Das's gift.
'I want you to see what I drew last night around the fire' she said.
She opened up her sketchpad which she often carried, artist that she was.
With an understanding smile she showed me a pencil drawing of a white eagle coming to rest on the shoulders of a kneeling man.
'That's what I saw when I looked at you last night, when you wept.
' she said.
'I think you should go with Prem Das yourself.
'

Almost in shock, I agreed.
That was when Wirikuta welcomed me into itself and began to shape a new creature from an old lump of clay.

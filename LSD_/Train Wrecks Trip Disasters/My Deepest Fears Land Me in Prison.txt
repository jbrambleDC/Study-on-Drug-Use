I am a friend of the person who was in this particular experience. He has told me exactly what to write, and I will write from his 1st person perspective.

This story takes place in Atlanta. I am 18 years old.

I had done LSD several times before this occurance. Each time had been the most pleasing of experiences, I had ventured through my thoughts and each time come out happily, seemingly on top of the world. Little did I know, my next trip would not be so beautiful...

It was a Friday night. That week at school I had done poorly on a couple of tests and when my parents found out they gave me hell. They called me stupid and threatened to send me to military school, you know, all the shit. I had also been having problems with my girlfriend. She found out that I had been doing drugs(I had not informed her, as she was not particularly fond of them). I tried to reason with her, but she would not have it. Our relationship continued to deteriorate until finally we broke up on the Thursday prior.

Well back to Friday night, I obviously had not been feeling too happy, so I decided to meet up with a few friends as a sort of pick-me-up. I met three of my friends at the movie theater, and one of them told me they had scored some LSD. One of the main rules of tripping is to always think good thoughts and be happy prior to your trip. This was where I made my mistake. I was incredibly depressed, but I decided to just fuck it and down 9 gel tabs. Ohhh shit why...My friends also had some, I am not sure how much.

We decided to go out to my friends car before the movie and smoke a few bowls. I had four. We then proceeded to see 'The Ring', FUCKING HUGE MISTAKE. GOD DAMMIT I was a retard for seeing that damn movie while tripping. Everything started out normal before the movie started. I was watching previews and the colors on the screen swirled and twisted in shape. They were so beautiful. I was sure this was going to be a pleasant trip, I would be brought out of my depression. Haha, wow was I fucking wrong...

So the movie started, and immediately I am transported to a world of fear and horror. If you have seen the ring, then you know the part where you see the girl in the closet, and her horribly contorted face. When I saw that, my friends and I completely lost it. We sprinted out of the theater screaming. I am pretty sure I was crying. I had never seen anything scarier in my life, but becasue I was tripping, I kept seeing the image over, and over again, as if the girl was right next to me. We luckily spotted another one of our friends (he was sober tonight). We told him what was going on and he was nice enough to drive us to my friends house, as we were obviously incapable. I looked out the window and I saw shadows instantly twist shape and turn into perverse faced demons. One shadow looked like fingers, and it turned into an arm that reached out and attempted to grab me and pull me down to hell. This arm had a voice. A deep, mysterious, terrifying voice, almost like the one of Indred Cold from The Mothman Prophecies. I pissed my pants I was so scared. We finally arrived home.

I felt as if this feeling would never go away as we walked into my friends basement. It was extremely dark down there, and in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing a terrifying, demented, evil face staring its deranged, menacing eyes into my eyes. My friends had kind of cooled down, but not me. We decided to smoke some more bowls to lift our moods. When it was my turn, I lit the zippo and I saw the flame, twisting twirling right in front of me. I was perplexed by it, I had never seen anything more interesting in my life. But out of nowhere, all the sudden the flame just exploded in my eyes and was the length of the room. I then saw dark figures crawling out of the flame, obviously coming to take me away. I sat there, quivering in fear. My hands were shaking so hard that I dropped the zippo and it fell on my leg. I sat there and saw it burning a hole through my pants and burning my leg, but I could not feel it.

Luckily, my friend noticed what was going on and knocked the zippo off my leg and my other friend picked it up and started to stare at it in pleasureful wonder. I wished I could feel that way. I started to cry, just all out cry. Why were my friends so much better off than me? Why the fuck does God hate me? I then started to scream, just scream my lungs out. My friend came over and pulled his hand back and slapped me vigorously across the face. I watched the motion of his hand and it seemed like 50 hands were coming across and slapping me, one by one. I had to retaliate. I took the lamp off the table next to me and threw it at his head. The glass lamp shattered across his face and he slumped to the floor. The light had singed his hair and his face was dripping with blood. It made me happy to see him in pain, to see somebody else going through the same thing I was. My two other friends weren't even watching as I got on top of my nearly unconcious friend and started beating him senseless with anything I could find.

Thankfully, his parents sprinted down the basement stairs and saw what was happening. They stopped me from potentially and unknowingly killing my friend. My two other friends had know idea what was going on because they were over in the other corners of the dark room tripping hard. The boys parents flicked on the lights and I was blinded by the light. I jumped off the boy and started to sprint out the door, where I jumped through a window thinking I was a hawk. Of course, we were in the basement, so I luckily just landed on the ground in front of me. The boy's parents called 911.

All of us were taken to the hospital, we had mostly come down from the trip by now. My friend was lying unconcious, barely alive, I had just now realized what I had done. I just had a broken left arm and some deep cuts from jumping through the window, but nothing like my friends wounds. The rest of us were taken to the police station for questioning. I admitted to ingesting the LSD but not to beating my friend. My friends admitted to nothing and wound up getting out scot free, fuckers...

But I was charged with assault and battering, and I had some geltabs in my pocket, so they charged me with drug possession too. I have been charged as an adult, so I am currently in jail, my friend visited me and took down this story. I am going to court soon, where they will ultimately find me out, they already told me they know I'm guilty, I have no case. I am fucked, royally fucked. I am still suffering from psycological trauma. LSD has taken my life down the tubes, but its really my own fault. I hope, somehow, I get the death sentence, because death would be better than this lifestyle.

The moral of the story is, don't fuck up. Don't trip when you are depressed and always trip with somebody sober. I didn't listen to the advice I read on the net, and now look at me...please, give me your prayers.

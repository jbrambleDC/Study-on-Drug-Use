This was my second time experimenting with acid and also most intense. I bought two blotter hits from a friend at band practice. it was a very thick deeply blue colored paper. I dosed 1 hit and had band practice which was the most amazing thing ever. it increased my musical ability 10 fold! After that, everything went down hill.

It was winter and it was night time. We were driving to a friends apartment very close by but only made it down the street before crashing into a ditch. Typical. Since that happened, I kept asking myself and one other person I was walking with if we had crashed and died. He said 'Yeah, your dead.' to fuck with me, which turned out not to be a good idea. When we got to the apartment, 4 other people were there we knew. and everyone was on acid at this point.

I dosed my second hit 45 minutes after the first, which was a big mistake. I underestimated the strength of my dose. Thinking I was dead this whole time, I now thought I could do anything I wanted without consequence. I almost raped my friend's girlfriend that was there (who was the only sober person) right in front of him thinking we could hook up cuz I was in fantasy world. I had extreme personality dettachment and ego dissolution. 

I preceded to trash my friend Dans apartment for no reason. I was dumping full ashtrays onto the floor, throwing videos at the door, knocking over tables and trying to break a window with a chair. He gave me a warning to leave but I could not communicate with anyone. I was totally disconnected from reality. He then punched me in the face and I flew backwards a number of feet slamming into a door. Although I did not feel one ounce of pain!

I scrambled to my feet and ran outside and away as fast as I could. I then started breaking windows of random houses and running away into a main road with heavy traffic nearly getting demolished by speeding cars. My insanity was inconceivable. I thought I was in my natural element and was free. But in reality I had pissed my self and removed every article of clothing I had on, including my shoes, and was running down the street naked. 

The cops surely came and slowly rolled along side me talking to me. They asked me if I had taken any drugs and I told them I took LSD and thought nothing of it. I tried to run away but they tackled me and brought me to the police station. I also spit in the police officers face inside the squad car after him asking me a reasonable question. Being in police custody was physically painful. All I could think about was losing my sanity for the rest of my life and be institutionalized. After being processed at 4:30 in the morning, a cop took me home. I regained my sanity but was having extreme visuals on the way home. 

My little adventure had made the newspaper and everything. Days and weeks afterward I was depressed and extremely embarassed for what I had done. Try explaining that to your girlfriend who is the sister of the girl I tried to hook up with!!! All in all, worst day of my life. Still paying off lawyer debts.

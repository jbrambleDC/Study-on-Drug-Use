About 1 month ago I went to a party with some friends.  Some acid was floating around and because I had been looking for some for a long time I decided to stock up.  I purchased 15 hits.  I planned to take 4 or 5 and not fry very hard because I didn't particularly like the environment and the vibes I was getting.

I took 5 tabs of acid around 8:00 and wasn't feeling very strong affects.  Angrily me and the other people frying began to think we'd been sold bunk shit.  We all decided we should pop a few more down.....worst mistake of my life.  I was now on 8 tabs.  And about 30 minutes later the 5 I'd taken previously began to kick in.  

Now I have taken alot of acid and this was by far the most intense trip ever.  So I was sitting at this party with my friends and the effects really start to hit.  The walls begin to wave around like the ocean, crashing onto the floor with thousands of color everywhere.  I began to wonder, 'can I handle this?  This is fucking intense.'  It began to appear as though everyone in the room's eyes had turned black and they were all laughing hysterically.  I found this quite curious.  Suddenly a deep fear came upon me, like a demonic or evil precense entered the room.  I sat quietly in my chair and closed my eyes because the things in front of me were far too intense.  

About a half hour later the 3 other tabs I'd taken began to kick in.  At that point I began to think I had taken too much and I was going to die or go permanently insane.  I opened my eyes for a few moments every now and then and would see the walls caving in on me and evil faces forming inside the colorful designs.  I glanced at the clock and realized I'd been tripping for one hour.  I was in shock. I thought to myself, 'can I maintain control for another 7 hours?  FUCK NO I CANT!'  

By this time all my friends taking acid with me had left.  I wasn't exactly sure where they had all gone.  But the only people left in the room were drunks.  My friend D was sitting next to me.  Suddenly I hear him begin to laugh.  I don't react quickly and I can hear the laughing increase to a loud hysterical roar.  I am wondering what the fuck is so funny and I look over at him.  (This was the most horrifying part of my trip.)  Next to me, what used to be D had transformed.  I look at D's face and it suddenly turned red (probably because he was laughing about something).   Then D turned to me, and he had horns on his head, a red face, and sharp teeth.  He smiles at me and quietly whispers 'welcome'.  Now I was not sure exactly what this meant.   But I had never felt so much terror in my life. 

I quickly stood up and said, 'I need to go for a fucking walk, I am tired of all this demon shit.'  So I proceed out the door shaking because of the stress.  I found it very hard to walk but I managed to make it to the end of the street (two houses down).  As I arrived at the end of the street, it was as though I got lost.  I didn't know where I was, what I was doing, who I was, and what was wrong with me.  I began to spin in circles trying to figure out where the fuck I was, with no success.  I heard a voice in the back of my head whisper, 'don't worry, someone is coming to pick you up soon.'  So I figured ok.  So I waited patiently at the side of the road waving at the semi trucks as they drove by hoping they were my ride.  I began to think, I can't wait this long, I need to die, I need to die.  So I began the task of trying to consider the best way to die.  

The rest of the night was hazy, but I remember spinning circles all night trying to decide my way of suicide, and waving at every car that drove by (which had to be in the hundreds), hoping that they were my ride.  It was like the acid was playing with me.  For 7 hours I stood on the side of the road, and every time I saw car lights my spirit would rise and I would think, 'finally!  My fucking ride!'  and as the car sped by, I could only fall deeper and deeper into sadness.  It was like a twisted trick.  The next day I began to think realistically, and I realized around 5 in the morning that no fucking ride was coming for my bitch ass.  So I walked to a gas station and called the police.  The police took me to the hospital, asked me where I'd gotten the drugs.  I simply told them I'd forgotten and wanted to be left alone.  

As I went into the hospital I began to think, Oh my god.  I died, I am dead.  To make things worse, the lady checking me in asked me what my religious preference was, I replied screaming, 'CHRISTIAN, I AM A FUCKING CHRISTIAN!  DONT SEND ME TO HELL!!!'  I feel onto the floor crying as I begged her not to send me to hell.  She quickly called security and had me escorted to a bed.  They put me to sleep, I woke up the next day and got a ride home.  

The moral of the story is....fuck acid, it will play with your mind.  I will never do acid again.  I believe it's the devil's drug or perhaps the devil's passage to gain control of your mind.  I wish that people would realize that they can get the same amount of joy and kicks by smoking pot and getting drunk.  Fuck, if you need to see colors, eat some fungi.  Don't mess with LSD.  I used to think Timothy Leary had a point to his message.  He was just a lost man, and now he is fucking dead.  Does anyone find it odd why bad trips on acid are so frequent?  And does anyone find it odd that all the hippies who used to fry serious balls all got jobs and gave up that shit, or are bums on the street cuz they can't think straight.  Acid is no good shit.  Don't even fuck with it.  It fucks with you...

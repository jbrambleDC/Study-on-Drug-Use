In highschool, I took LSD many times as a recreational drug until I ultimatly 'pierced the veil' on a few trips, with unpleasent mental results, and no longer take it.  However, I know many people take LSD as a 'fun drug' and not as a tool for introspection, and I'm writing this as a warning of what can happen in the wrong set and setting.

I hadn't intended to trip on the day in question, but did so impulsively when someone offered me cheap geltabs.  They were purple, and literally as thick as a guitar pick.  I was unsure of how much to take, but ended up consuming 2-3 at around 11:00AM, figuring classes would be over (at 1:50) before the hardest part of the trip kicked in, and that I'd just skip my classes and wander around the campus/town anyway.  I shortly thereafter remembered that I had a doctors appointment at 4:30, and that my mother was going to pick me up at 5:00 (it was my senior year, but I believe my license was suspended at the time due to traffic tickets).  Based on what I've read, I'd put the dose at around 350 ug, but I have no real way of knowing.

An hour or so later, I got the usual body-kick/giggly feeling, intensification of light, patterns, etc, but soon realized things were going to go bad.... I'd be walking through the halls hearing fragments of conversation, and my mind would weave them into conversations about me, my name being called etc, I remember at one point laughing and saying to no one, 'THAT, is paranoia......'.

I got out of school, and decided (foolishly) that since pot usually has the effect of making me calm, it would calm me down enough to go to the doctors.  I had $40 on me that I had been intending to spend on pot, I think my plan was to by a 1/2oz bag for 50, but had spent $10 on the acid, I'm not sure.  So I went to the local park with a kid I knew, he was a heavy user of pot, and he agreed to help me around (I knew I was tripping too hard to walk around streets by myself) if I could give him a ride home, which I wasn't sure I could do, but I didn't feel that bad lying to him because I was really freaked out.

There were 3 people in a car in the park with some really strong nuggets, they wanted $40/eigth, and it was hard to talk to them, I kept getting paranoid.  But I know I bought the bag and smoked a bowl with them and the person I was with, and really started to freak out..... I wandered around town (small town, just a crossroads, a strip of stores, etc) with him in a daze, at one point I really started to freak out and I said 'I'm having a bad trip' and he just kept saying, 'No, you're not', and that helped calm me down.  But we kept smoking pot until finally I was laying on the roof of a building, staring at the trees above me, and they broke up in 100 other things, nymphs, dryads, etc, in my mind..... but it wasn't the sense of 'being everything' (or alternately, just that 'everything is one') that psychedelic doses of LSD can bring, this was just everything being out of control, broken, and I couldn't make sense of it..... 

I remember being across the street from my school, and saying something about needing to get down off the roof, and my friend said, 'don't you know where we are?' and I said 'yes, we're on the roof of the pizza place', and he said 'no, look around, man, we left there a long time ago', and I realized he was right, or at least that I believed him, my abilty to interpret visual perceptions was destroyed, I was totally lost in my head, paranoid, I didn't even really know I was on a drug, I just knew I was lost and had to be back at the school at 4:30, I HAD to be there or else BAD THINGS would happen, I HAD to see my mother, it was like being lost at the mall when I was 5 and really scared and I just HAD TO FIND MY MOTHER because she could make it all right, except I knew it wasn't like that at all, and it was all coming in so damn fast I could't process it at all. 

We got in a van with a bunch of people and the remainder of the pot was passed around and smoked, I remmeber seeing road signs and not knowing what they really meant, but somewhere in the back of my head I knew I had to be back in front of my school at 4:30, and I got obsessed with this, and I kept asking 'what time is it? What time is it?' and finally they got pissed and set all the clocks in the van to like 7PM, and I freaked out, but then we got back to the school, and a few minutes later my mother pulls up, and I manage to say 'can we give (my friend) a ride home?' and she says, 'no, you're going to be late', so I think he was pissed, he walked away, I got in the car and it was all weird and broken, I don't really remember it all that clearly, and she thought I was stoned and was mildly irritated and said, 'were you guys smoking pot?' and it seemed TOTALLY logical to say 'no, I'm on acid', and she got really pissed. 

At the doctors they ended up just having me sit in a dark room for an hour until I'd calmed down and was somewhat lucid again, and they decided I needed to be removed from classes for 2 months (got to do work at home, yay) because my judgement about taking drugs was bad, AND my parents made me pay for the doctor's appointment, since it was pretty much a waste of money.

The moral here is, anyone can have a bad trip anytime, and yeah, at least at my HS there were a fair number of people who took low-to-mid dose LSD in school, but that doesn't make it a good idea.  For some people this drug is a bad idea anytime, and I would very much recommend waiting until you're at least 20 or so to really screw around with it, because hopefully by then you'll be directed and independant enough to integrate the experience into your life.  I've had major problems integrating the psychedelic expirience with my life, I think I was bound to have problems with anxiety/disassociation, I don't blame these personality traits on drugs, but I think LSD made them more visual in their nature.

I explicitly wanted to experience mixing Sertraline and MDMA because I couldnt find many mixing experiences documented online and I plan on going on a weekend trip with my girlfriends in a few weeks where we will likely be taking multiple doses of MDMA. Let me start out by saying Ive only done MDMA about 6 times over the past 2 years. I am not a frequent user, but I love it when I have access to it. Ive been taking up to 150 mg of Zoloft (Sertraline) for the last 3 months to deal with major anxiety and breathing issues surrounding my upcoming wedding.

I had taken the Setraline at 3pm and I took my first MDMA tablet at 10:15 pm. By 11pm, I could already feel the happiness and lightness wash over me. I was hanging in my friend Ds living room and immediately felt inspired to do yoga. I just love stretching when I feel this way. I feel my entire body loosen up and come alive. It makes me wonder how much physical flexibility is related to a free mind. Hmmm  I just love the fact that time crawls when I take MDMA. I dont want the feeling to ever end and fortunately, the clock seemed to be moving slowly. This made me happy. I knew I was in for a glorious evening. 

Suddenly a friend dropped a second dose of MDMA. Being an adventurer, I decided to follow and take a second as well. At first I was scared. What if I have a bad reaction to the Sertraline? Fortunately, I never did experience any discomfort or increase in anxiety or anything else that I feared. If anything, the MDMA was less intense as a result of the Sertraline, but it was intense enough, it was a smooth and joyous evening. 

At midnight, after much giggling and deep therapeutic talking, we ventured to a nightclub where my friend has connections. We ran 10 blocks through the rain and it felt delicious. Ive seen the streets of my city 1,000 times  but tonight the wet streets sparkled from the reflections of the lights and neon store signs. It made me want to paint. Fortunately, the DJ at the club was off the hook. By 2am I am soaked in sweat, twirling amidst a group of friends and strangers, and feeling so alive and free.

I was finally able to confront my deep challenges with anxiety and face head on the fears I suppress on a daily basis. I was able to see that I fear becoming a wife having been raised to be so independent. I realized that I can define wife. I dont have to take on anyone elses definition. This was very healing for me. Thanks MDMA!

We didnt leave the club until 6am. We crawled home and I slept on the sofa. This was perhaps the WILDEST part of the evening. As I layed down and shut my eyes, my ear drums seemed to be hypersensitive and I think I was tuned into some very low and high frequencies of vibrations as sounds. My inner ears were fluttering and I felt like I was tapped into sounds I wouldnt normally hear. There was a cacophonous orchestra of low rumblings and high scales. Perhaps it was just my ears reacting to the load music from the club. But I think it was special. I think I was hearing the state of my environment. Also, when I closed my eyes, I also saw wild fire burning through swirls of neon blue and red. It was kind of annoying. I just wanted to go to sleep. After about 30 minutes I was able to sleep.

Its now 2 days later. I slept for the last 20 hours  I think I really needed it. I feel almost 100% today  a little jittery  but not depressed and even a tad less anxious! I took 150 of Setraline last night so that I stay on my plan with my doctor. Verdict  science experiment successful.

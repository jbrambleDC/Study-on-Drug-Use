I like drugs, I've taken my fair share of marijuana, mushrooms, and LSD, I've tried Cocaine once, DXM (Cough syrup) once. I've tried LSA from Morning Glory seeds a few times as well. I've never been very big on drinking (I find when I do, I drink too much), but I do partake in a drink here and there to much merriment and good times.

I have the luck and pleasure of my drug dealer also being a friend I've known since a very young age. I usually only buy Marijuana and the occasional bunch of mushrooms off him. He recently came into contact with an ounce of what he calls pure MDMA. I inspected the crystals, they were kind of milky in transparency and had a mild yellow colour to it. Using a simple scale he usually uses for Marijuana he scaled out .26 grams of this stuff and crushed it into a powder... (260mg, correct?)

~SIDE NOTE~   When I refer to being good, I am referring to the level of mood and effects being close perfect, or at least what one expected or desired.

DATE: Friday, January 15, 2010

8:25 PM -  He then wrapped the crystal in a simple rolling paper and I swallowed it without water. I purchased a gram of marijuana, said my good byes and went home. Generally speaking, I will research a drug or chemical EXTENSIVELY before I ingest it, but for whatever reason (probably school) I was too busy to research MDMA as it has never really struck my fancy. In short, I knew very little of the drug I just took. I've had a few episodes of complete insanity on both Mushrooms and LSD, luckily I was in the comfort of my own home with my parents quite aware of my predicament, so even though I was unsure of what effects I would experience and to what intensity, I felt safe and secure in my home.

9:02 PM  It had been half an hour since I had taken the drug and was beginning to think it was going to be a mild experience.

9:45 PM -  I smoked a bowl of Marijuana thinking I wasn't going to get much from the MDMA alone, I was only mildly light headed, I could get a better buzz off of a beer at this point. It had been over an hour and I was beginning to worry at the quality of what my dealer called pure MDMA, it's good.

10:00 PM -  I felt really good! Still only mildly dizzy but that bowl of marijuana greatly improved my mood.

10:30 PM  I started to get an increased mood lift, talking to my best friend on MSN who I will call Charles. We talked about things I normally wouldn't say to him as it would make me uncomfortable. I felt free of any mental security system. I find I'm a very reserved individual and I keep most of my thoughts to myself. It's difficult to open up with people. I invited this friend over to hang out and see my MDMA madness, but alas he already had an engagement with a lady friend. Luckily, the happiness I felt at that time made this situation a lot easier and I didn't feel at all sad about being alone. So, it has been approx. 2 full hours since I ingested the 260 mg, and even though it was wrapped in a rolling paper, I would have thought I would be tripping balls at this point but I was not... I was on the other hand coming up. I didn't realize how high I was going to get either, but from what I felt at that point, I was quite content with the effects.

10:45 PM  I was FLYING, the come up hit me really fast. In an hour I went from Meh, weed is better. to HOLY SHIT THIS STUFF IS AWESOME! So a little over 2 hours from the original point of ingesting and I was peaking, it was absolutely wonderful! My dealer had informed me to drink lots of water, and I was now on my second glass, chugging this clear liquid down like it was part of the inebriating experience. I felt like, the more I drank, the higher I would get. (Fret not, I didn't go crazy with the water, I know how to take things in moderation...usually.)

11:02 PM  It's now 11, and I decided to start writing all this stuff down and document it. You might notice every entry before this point was in the past tense, from now on I will try to keep it present. I find I am clenching my jaw and teeth together. I am also squeezing and bending my fingers around uncontrollable, I feel this may be sore or hurt later, but for now it feels good. I have mildly blurry vision, I see wispy patterns on everything, but not enough or pronounced enough to be considered a full blown psychedelic experience, but the patterns on their own are quite creative, I would attribute it to the marijuana. I am sweating a lot, drinking my fair share of water and Pepsi. The two massive projects I have to do this weekend and have done by Monday seem unimportant.

11:07 PM  I'm sweating a lot. I'm starting to think about how I was talking to my Mom earlier, and I feel I know what she was keeping something from me that I couldn't detect then when I was talking to her NOT on drugs, but now looking back on it, I think the increased empathy from MDMA helped me realize something. Even though my Mom is disappointed in me I don't really care, probably because of the drug, this thought is a mild dampener on my mood, but I'm sure I'll forget about it momentarily...

11:11 PM  MAKE A WISH. ;]

11:12 PM  It's a Friday night and I chose to stay home by myself and play video games on drugs, but now that I'm on this new substance, I feel more inclined to document the effects of MDMA than play anything. Some might think me a loser, but I am quite confident with myself, I'm an introvert and prefer alone time to being with others.

11:26 PM  I've been playing Assassin's Creed II, but I now feel distracted with how my Mom might feel about me right now. I'm still squeezing my fingers, sweating and clenching my jaw uncontrollably. Thinking about the amount now, I took over 200 mg of MDMA more likely than not almost 100% pure. I went online and began to read about the effects and doses of MDMA, I was surprised to find 100 mg would be considered a good trip on its own.

11:29 PM  I find it's easier to make a trip report on MDMA than say a psychedelic such as psilocybin or LSD. My thoughts are a little more clear than that of a psychedelic. I'm very much enjoying this and have decided to smoke another bowl of Marijuana. 

11:39 PM  Just smoked my second bowl of the evening, bigger than the first, and a new strain of herb, it was gooooood. ;] I feel pretty fucked up, in the way, my body is just kind of fidgeting and doing weird stuff (like holding my arms out and just flapping my hands around, they felt funny when they were all limp...), but it feels good and non-damaging, so why not? I feel good.

On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best and happiest I've ever been in my whole life. I would give this an 8, possibly even a 9....9 is my favourite number. ;]

11:49 PM  I have been petting my cat on and off the entire come up, now she is lying down on my bed and seems really sleepy and out of it, Could my sweat possibly be absorbed by my cats sensitive skin?)

DATE: Saturday, January 16, 2010

12:52 AM - I just spent the past hour talking to a good friend on MSN. I felt some bonding, I think...you have a beautiful belly. ;]

1:03 AM  I feel sort of like I'm coming down a bit, I'm drinking lots of water, my 3rd glass, maybe 5th I haven't really kept track...I might just smoke another bowl. >;]

1:07 AM  Yes, I will smoke another bowl.

1:09 AM  Very good. ;] I'm definitely not at the peak I was before but I'm still really good. I'm considering spending the 40 dollars I have on more drugs. DRUGS DRUGS DRUGS BLEEEHHHH

1:28 AM  That bowl got me a lot more high than I thought it would, quite good indeed. Still clenching my jaw, put some gum in my mouth, chewing on that. Mmmmmm....This Stride gum flavour is... Forever Fruit.

1:32 AM  As of right now, I feel that I am coming down, and the only thing keeping me up is the marijuana. I very much enjoyed the experience it was extremely euphoric, mild visual distortions. They were quite trippy, it might be attributed to the weed though, I believe marijuana is an hallucinogen...

1:45 AM  My friend, Charles, who I had invited over earlier had returned home from his endeavour and was quite willing to chill for the remainder of the evening. So, we departed from our separate living spaces and met up at the dealers house. I purchased another 600 mg of this substance and we went back to my house. (Me and Charles, not the dealer)

2:13 AM  We both swallowed approx. 300mg each, in a PARACHUTE (wrap crushed mdma crystals in half of a rolling paper and swallow it), I had already ingested 260mg at 8:25 PM, this being my first experience on MDMA, I was curious as to the effects of a re-dose, especially before I went to sleep, or allowed a full come down and tolerance to build up.

2:58 AM  We snorted the last 40mg of it with a straw on a mirror. I took mine in two lines, one in each nostril, Charles took all 20 mg of his in 1 line. The reason we snorted a bit, was because, since it was already so late, we didn't want to waste a full hour waiting for the effects of ingesting it.

3:03 AM  PACKING A BOWL

3:38 AM  I feel like I'm flying. Charles is quite pleased with the insulating effects of MDMA.

4:20 AM  PACKING ANOTHER BOWL! ;D

4:32 AM  Still working on that bowl....

4:45 AM  STILL working on that bowl... Petting my kitty. ;] She's on my lap.

4:49 AM  I feel really fucked up, my vision is all flickery, I'm going to smoke a bowl now....

5:03 AM  Finally smoked that bowl. ;] It took me a solid 40 minutes to pack and smoke a bowl. I find as the evening is gone and we work our way into the morning I find it more difficult to concentrate on one thing or idea and my mind is flickering all over the place. I would say, from my re-dose, I was returned to 80%-90% of full effects from my peak at 11 PM to 1 AM, which was well worth the purchase in my opinion, and it allowed me to partake in Charles trip as well, so that he wasn't tripping alone.

5:04 AM  I have urinated A LOT during this trip (At least 5 time, which is quite a bit for one evening), and I have also sweat profusely, it is quite evident how dehydrating this drug is.

5:13 AM  This drug is awesome, playing Assassin's Creed II on the PS3, quite high, loving life.

6:41 AM  Deep bonding and connection with friend. No homo. We have been talking about life, the universe and everything delicious.

6:49 AM  Perhaps another bowl? I do suspect I smoke the herb a bit too much.

7:46 AM  I do believe I am no longer under the effects of MDMA, overall it was a very enjoyable experience. ;] I feel a little tired, and bored, mildly regretting a few actions.

DATE: Sunday, January 17, 2010

It has been a full day without MDMA and I would like to take a chance to reflect on my experience while not under the influence of drugs. I did not bother doing this yesterday as I was QUITE exhausted yesterday, I had an empty depressed mood all day and I accomplished VERY little and ended up going to bed at 8:30 PM a full 24 hours from the time of ingestion.

Upon getting a full nights sleep and looking back, there's quite a few things I feel uncomfortable about, things I said to people, I wish I could take it back...I feel embarrassed, and insecure.

As for the depression I felt yesterday, I would attribute that to the fact that I didn't smoke any marijuana all day, I had no appetite and in turn ate very little (A bowl of cereal and 2 pancakes, all day), and I was also quite exhausted as I am not accustomed to pulling an all nighter. Another theory I have about my depleted mood would be how my brain was functioning after the drug. MDMA basically overloads receptors in your brain right? The part that makes you feel good? I have a very basic understanding of this, but from what I understand, after taking any drug that interacts with these receptors, your brain will tighten up those receptors, letting less natural brain chemicals through (dopamine, serotonin?), and in turn making it much more difficult to be happy.

Another thing, is the sweating...I was dropping beads of sweat and it was QUITE obvious my body temperature was considerably higher than usual. I think that part of this could be attributed to where I was though and the fact that I had imbibed a lot of water. It's winter, very cold outside, so we figured it would be better to trip in the comfort of my own room, I have a lot of electronics in my room, as well as Christmas lights on at almost all times. We also had the door shut, so we didn't wake anybody while tripping all night. When you add all that up. 2 males, a computer, PS3, television and Christmas lights, it got pretty hot in here, no homo. :P I never thought to check the temperature of the room, but I'm sure it was much hotter than usual, which is probably at least PART of the reason I sweat so much.

On a final note, since I have gotten a full nights rest, I feel much better about the experience now, than I did yesterday. I took a total of 560 mg spaced over the evening, it felt really good. I'm going to see how much of those projects I can get done today, but I'm not too worried about it. I feel good, and productive, I've already done a few chores. I feel happy again, I very much enjoyed my experience. I'm in no rush to try it again, but I would consider the idea in the future

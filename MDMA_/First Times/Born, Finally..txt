I have been born, finally.  Two nights ago I experienced the gently, cuddly, truthful effects of MDMA in its purest form alongside my cuddle thing at the time.  

It was Christmas Eve of 2007 and my ladyfriend brought over some food that she turned into a feast while we began our adventure into the foreign land of ecstasy that she initiated in the first ten seconds of our visit when she placed a parachute in my mouth (approx 80-100mg molly).  For those who aren't familiar, a parachute or 'bomb' is a dose of MDMA or another powder wadded up in a cigarette paper for swallowing.  

About a half hour after she dosed me I began to feel adrenergic rushes in my chest.  Some of this must have been from my slight anxiety of a new psychoactive substance.  

An hour into it we both plateaued.  The feeling had progressed from a light rushy-anxious, to slight goofy drunk-like incoordination, to pure bliss - pure calm bliss.  I was mentally stimulated, which I somewhat expected from my research on this chemical.  It's an amphetamine analogue after all, so why wouldn't there be some sort of stimulation?  It was similar to the euphoria of a solid, but controlled alcohol buzz, but with a mental  stimulation similar to a low dose of Adderall (I have a prescription that I take 4-5 times a week.)  

I however found myself losing track of what I was doing frequently, like a non-linear mental stimulation.  I didn't really care though.  I was in my own safe and comforting living room, there was food cooking, there was a cute female being fun, there was a new blanket wrapped around me that she had given me as a gift that night, my old and beloved kitty cat was roaming around and visiting from time to time, and there was a fantastic dub step mix playing on my stereo at a medium-soft volume.  I feel that the setting for a first dabbling into such a type of psychedelic was absolutely perfect.  There's not much that could have improved upon the setting, despite the failed plans earlier that evening (we were supposed to drop at the beach in time to watch the sunset, but she got stuck in nasty traffic.)  

Once I plateaued for a solid 45 minutes or so I decided to snort a miniscule bump of the remaining powder.  My theory was that since I was already at a wonderful orally induced level of ecstasy (pun or not), that a little tiny bump insufflated would put me way higher due to the intensity and time difference of snorting vs ingesting a substance.  It surely did.  About a minute and a half after that little burn in my nostril, I was projected into a buzzing full-body orgasm for the next 30-40 minutes, that's compared to the level I had already been at.  

Throughout the night we cuddled, snuggled, kissed, ate, drank a drink's worth each of absinthe (another gift from her wonderfullness).  At this point the 10:52 time mark of a live recording of Sasha and Pete Tong, Live @ Creamfields, Liverpool made me completely entranced in the music to which we were listening for a few moments.  MDMA heightens one's senses all around - tactile, visual, olfactory, emotional, and aural, and totally lowers or eliminates most inhibitions.  

Sex is fantastic under the influence of this substance.  I have heard that it's a bad idea to have sex while rolling, because it'll never feel the same or as good afterwards.  That's total bull.  It deepens how I do it, and under what circumstances.  Molly's grips on my body were lightening when my female friend decided to get naked and jump on me with her legs sprawled, as in I was coming down.  I was feeling so much pleasure from the drug alone at that point that I didn't need to have an orgasm, and in fact I didn't want to because I simply felt good enough as I was.  We cuddled up for a while, I ended up crashing out for an hour or two, only to wake up feeling still wonderful.  We decided to share a bottle of champagne that I had gotten for the occasion.  Although mixing a diuretic with the opposite is supposed to be bad, since we weren't dancing and were in a safe place it seemed like an ok plan.  It tasted so incredibly good, and the bubbles felt so good in my mouth that the bottle just disappeared in 20-30 minutes.  No alcohol buzz.  Simply good-flavored champagne soda :)

-------------------------------

For my entire lifetime, minus two and a half days, I've questioned my life as deeply depressed.  I have had many mood problems aside from losing one of my best friends, my father, about three months ago to ALS syndrome.  I've simply had various emotional problems almost forever, but I so far have not completely come down from the high of two nights ago.  The psychedelic effects are gone, the visuals, the tactile manipulations, the weird stuff that's not normal, the chills and buzzes all over my body, but the lessons learned are with me forever.  I will never look at someone downward like I have before.  

I now am the most joyful person ever to live, I insist, and I want to share that with everyone with whom I cross paths one way or another.  Even though I'd love to feel the rushes I felt that night again, I'm not sure I want to take the chance on having a lesser experience than I did for my first time with molly.  This is certainly a mindset whose novelty I will never allow to vanish or lessen.  

Just a fun little side note, the evening after this experience on my way to work (I'm a bartender at a high volume fine dining restaurant) I popped my usual dosage of adderall - it helps my manage the bar efficiently, especially when I'm a little tired or hung over, and by the way aside from a little tiredness I felt great still through a few days after so far.  Once the adderall kicked in, I had a cigarette, parked my car, lit another one on my way to the back door of the restaurant, and all of a sudden before I walked in I realized I had a roll manifesting!  It must have been the remaining MDMA acting as an ssri and an amphetamine combo working in sync with the dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine mixture of adderall, plus the acetylcholine activation and dopamine release from the two cigarettes that gave my entire body a huge amount of chills and buzzing rushes that got my through the night happier than anyone drinking fine wine at my bar.

Love to everyone out there!

Me and a few friends had an unusual experience recently. We take ecstasy pretty often and are experienced users, but this night was different from any other night we had ever taken it. 

10:00 PM
We dropped our first pill and decided to just hang around at my house. The pills were double stacked pink butterflys, but we didn't think they were anything special. So we dropped another pretty quickly. 

10:20 PM
After we took our second pill, it was all over. The come up came and went in about 2 minutes and before we knew it we were pretty much fucked. I've never had anything happen like that.

11:00 PM 
This roll was definitely different. Eye jitters and jaw chattering were uncontrollable for all of us. The intensity was so strong it was almost unbearable. I almost thought I was even going to pass out a few times because I felt so dizzy. Walking around was a challenge. Speaking was difficult. We were all pretty much glued to the floor for the moment. What we didn't know was that these little pills had a surprise in store for us.

11:15 PM
It was definately hard to focus on anything. But I started to notice I was having alot of strange visuals. I turned and looked at my friend and his face was distorted. I had to stare a moment to try and make it become clear, but the longer I stared the more fucked up his face became. There was a clear layer of shifting and morphing geometric shapes on everything. Music sounded especially beautiful. 

Time... ? .... could't read the clock. So on we moved to the backyard. We all needed a smoke and we wanted to get some better visuals. The night air seemed freezing but I walked out to the middle of the yard and layed down on my blanket starring up at the stars. Unbelievable... The moon lit up a few clouds that were surrounding it. They slowly morphed into different extremely detailed objects, like a huge owl that was slowly flapping its wings...and so on. I was enjoying it so much. But I couldn't help but wonder how I was seeing these things. I decided to forget about it and just let it flow. I got my friends attention, and they all came and lay beside me. They too saw some amazing things in the sky. 

With some help, we decided it was 3:00 AM. We were back inside. I snuggled up on the couch, and lay my head back in my friend's lap. I let everything fade away and concentrated on the feeling and the music. It was beautiful. Closed eye visuals were a little scary, so I decide not to shut my eyes. Then I noticed little tiny floating neon balls of light everywhere. I stared at them in amazement. After it seemed like an eternity I snapped out of my trance. It was now 6:00. I noticed that we all had been in the same spot for 3 hours. I decided I would try to get up and get everyone water. 

7:00 AM 
Still rolling but the visuals were gone. I kept thinking how unblievable that was, and my friends and I all shared what we experienced. 

8:00 AM 
The come down was fucking horrible. I tried walking to the bathroom and everything turned white. I freaked out. It wasnt like I was going to pass out but I couldn't see anything. I yelled for my friends to help me, and they carried me outside. I was so afraid that I was going blind. i still couldn't see anything. I sat down for awhile and slowly my vision faded back in. It was so strange. 

Later on, none of us could sleep and we also had terrible body aches. Even though the comedown was bad I still had an unbelievable night.

[Erowid Note: 
While it may be that the substance described is pure MDMA, Ecstasy/Molly tablets and powders are notoriously impure, misrepresented, or adulterated. Ecstasy sold in retail contexts such as festivals or parties often contain chemicals other than MDMA.] 

[Erowid Note: This substance was sold as Ecstasy, but readers should be aware there are aspects of the report that suggest that the contents of the pills were not MDMA.  We've marked the substance as 'unknown'.]  

It was a cool summer afternoon in beautiful WA, and the setting was a pretty big party called 'Water' out in the boonies, and was scheduled for the whole weekend. Ok when I say big, I guess I am really meaning like 10000+ people all converged into one massive rave with 7 stages, 2 of them revolving, and a huge list of DJs. Me and 3 other friends drove out to the location and proceeded to set up our tents since we already knew that we would be to fucked up to set them up later. After the tents were set up, we proceeded on our hunt for some good drugs. Ecstasy was really our drug of choice at that time, so we asked around, and finally found a guy who had 'some good shit'.

The guy was kinda shady after a little bit of reflection on the deal, but he called the pills 'mini amsterdams', which was a new name that neither I, nor my friends, had ever heard of. All of us have a good amount of experience with MDMA, but I swear sometimes you hear a new name, or stamp every week. The pills were white, 75mg as an estimate, and slightly oval in shape. I bought 2, and 1 other friend 'D' bought 2 as well. And we both popped one each, after the deal was done. Now most the time I do a little trick to figure out if my pill is really a MDMA, and I'll hold the pill on my tongue for less then a minute. From my past experience, ecstacy is very bitter, and has a memorable taste, and usually I'm pretty good with my little talent.

I don't remember exactly, but I must have been satisfied with my analysis, and convinced my friend it was OK to take his. All 4 of us decided to go check out the music since it was getting well underway. I felt quite normal for the first 2 hours, and my friend said the same thing. We both decided to take the remaining pill that we both had. After about a half hour afterwards, I knew that I was starting to feel something. Kind of light headed at first. Suddenly things started to turn for the worse. When it did, it caught me completely off guard. I was just dancing and out of nowhere, I start to vomit, and its almost like when a water hose is turned on. A solid jet of water shooting about 4 feet from me. The weirdest thing about it, was that there was absolutely no nausea at all. My stomach would clench, and I would shoot water out my mouth. I would be ok for 30 seconds, and then it would happen again. Luckily I hadn't eaten all day, and really just had water in my belly up until that point. Almost immediately after my legs felt like rubber, and walking was a task in itself. I knew from that point that it wasn't E that I had taken, but something else.

With a good amount of panic setting in, and with my friends nowhere in sight, I decided that I should try to find our tent to lay down. So I start to make my way back to where I hope that would be, and every single persons' face that I look at, starts to twist and malform into diabolical shapes of terror. Each face, with this completely evil grimace, and rows of sharp fangs, and empty eyes staring back at me. It's really the mouths that truly scared the shit out of me, they constantly shake and move almost like the person it belongs to is chanting some incantation under its breath. In my perception I'm walking around literally thousands of demons, that look as if they are all about to rip me and my soul apart. Some make eye contact with me, but I don't feel evil intentions in any of them, its just those goddamn ravenous mouths. As much as I can, I try to avoid looking at anyone, completely out of fear.

After walking what seemed an eternity though these waves of malevolent beings, I come across the tent area. There are thousands of people here and a good portion are camping the whole weekend, so the tent area is really spread out into a tent metropolis. There are tents EVERYWHERE, and I have a head full of some unknown potent psychedelic substance that is tearing my sanity apart, and I am completely lost. I stumbled into a couple of tents hoping that I was in the right tent, but I'm only met with kind strangers looking at me oddly, as oddly as I'm staring back at them, watching their faces continually contort and shift, and yes the mouths are just as menacing as they were earlier. One tent I stumbled in had 3-4 people (that I remember) that seemed to be more or less naked and writhing together, making quite erotic noises. Amazingly they weren't upset, and asked if I would like to join, as another pulled my arm when I tried to leave. Needless to say I was more focused on finding my friends and the safe haven of our tent, then participating in some random orgy with a bunch of strangers, although now it sounds like it may have been quite a bit of fun.

Finally after much searching, I see my friends and I rush over to them, in hopes that maybe my friend 'D' is ok. But it's my other 2 buddies I came down with. The tell me that D is in the tent already and that he had been quiet for most the time they had saw him. I get in the tent and sure enough there's D laying down, but his eyes are open. I ask how he's holding up and he grunts at me. I tell him about all the crazy shit that I was seeing and all the other stuff that had happened. He tells me that he's too scared to go outside and that he too had been seeing some incredibly disturbing stuff. So I get comfy and we lay there talking about the normal drug induced, existential topics. 

By this time I really feel like I'm peaking, and hard. As D is talking to me, I look over once and he has the same demon mouth, that I had been seeing all night, but it doesn't freak me out as much when it belongs to someone I know. I look over a second time and he looks like a freakin anime cartoon character. This amazes me, all his features are hand drawn it seems, and I have a hard time focusing on what he's talking about. The third time I look at him, he looks EXACTLY like my friend Steve. It basically IS Steve, but the voice belongs to D, so very strange this drug is. I lay back and start to look around at the tent. I see peoples shadows dancing on the sides, and at times the shadows change and take on shapes of random animals. I look at the blanket thats covering me, which is decorated with a type of vine pattern, and as I stare the vines from the blanket actually start to grow. Up the sides of the tent I watch as these vines grow and wrap around each other, and at one point they actually cover most of the inside of the tent as I watch in amazement.

I continually kept getting up and going outside of the tent, only to get creeped out and look around all confused, and wonder, 'What in the hell am I doing?' to which I just end up going back inside in disappointment and more confused. I finally start to chill out and close my eyes for awhile. Loud pumping music has been going on the entire time, and I start to focus on that. I have taken several different hallucinogens and never once have I experienced synesthesia, until that point. Wow, I could actually SEE the music, how fucking weird. Certain sounds would be assigned certain colors, but at times the sounds could be any color they chose. These colorful sounds began to form together into a single rotating object, that was highly detailed and constantly shifting and changing to the music. Eventually I was able to fall asleep as I watched this beautiful vision in my mind.

The next morning I woke up, and everything and everyone was back to normal. I'd say the whole trip was 8+ hours, including waiting for the effects to start. My buddy D, said that he kept seeing huge insects walking on top of the tent and that 'something' kept whispering to him throughout the night. To this day I still don't know for sure what it was that we took. From reading up on some different substances and experiences, I believe it may have been Mescaline. The only other ones I've read up on that sound similar would be 2-CB or one of 2-CB's cousins. Either way what a trip it was.

[Erowid Note: The author of this report believes they may have taken mescaline; it is very, very unlikely to be mescaline, which is generally unavailable in the U.S. street drug market.]

I had found out about amanita muscaria on the internet, in my search for legal substances I can use to get messed up. I ordered 1 ounce and was given a complimentary 7 grams on top of this. I read all the trip reports concerning amanitas because I really didn't know what to expect, and personally did not know anybody who had ever tried them. So I was a little scared at first, but I figured the only way to find out was to do it.

I had planned on waiting till the evening to do them with my fiance, (we'll call her T) but she was having very bad cramps and could hardly walk. I had heard that amanitas dulled or removed your ability to feel pain so I told her that if she would like she could eat her dose (10 grams) of the amanitas, she agreed and since we always do every drug we try together I ate my dose (15 grams) also. It was about 3pm. 

3:30pm--I was beginning to feel the first effects of the shrooms, which for me is a slight blurriness of vision, T could feel nothing.

4:00pm--still just a bluriness of vision, T feels only a slight change.

4:30pm--starting to feel a few more effects, feeling a slight buzz, and I also feel a little tired for some reason, similar to the way I feel when I smoke weed.

5:00pm--the effects are really starting to kick in, it takes a slight amount of concentration to walk normally, and I have a very hard time reading anything, once I get a few words into the sentence it no longer makes any sense to me, also I don't seem to be feeling much pain. T seems to be feeling the effects much more mildly then me, possibly a high dosage curve.

6:00pm--I really just want to sit down, or lay down, Im really tired now so me and T go lay down, T is feeling tired too but Im not sure if it was the amanitas.

6:20pm minutes--T fell asleep but I just sat there awake because I was enjoying the feeling, some slight body rushing, walls shifted often, a few mild visuals, moderate to strong closed eye visuals, making it hard for me to actually fall asleep when I did try, I kept hearing noises I knew weren't there, or I would here something said on tv but it would be 10 times louder for a few seconds, and it would make no sense, this happened until I fell asleep at about 220 minutes after ingestion.

10:00pm--my roommate wakes me up for some reason, I can't remember why, T is still sleeping, most likely sleeping through the peak effects, which is fine because my main reason for eating the amanitas at the time which we did was so that she could be free of her cramps. I get up and walk around and can still feel the effects, but not nearly as strong as I had earlier, I must have peaked shortly after I fell asleep. 

At this point I decide to chat on the internet, and I find out that there is a desert rave not to far from where I live, T had wanted to go to a rave for a while, and I figured I would take her, and we could do mdma and have a fun time. It should be noted that by this time I was only feeling mild effects from the Amanitas, but I also felt a little 'strange' and was acting a little different then normal.

We leave around 12 pm and get to the rave around 12:15, after we walk around for awhile. We purchase 2 mdma tablets, one for each of us. 

T took her pill at 12:40. It should be noted that we did not take the mdma orally, we took it rectally, I had heard that this extended the experience and made it more intense. I waited 30 minutes before taking my pill because it always takes alot longer for drugs to begin to affect T then to affect me. Also I was afraid of taking the pills rectally so I was a little reluctant at first. I finally took the pill at about 1:10.

1:40am--T is beginning to feel the effects, and I am too, it seems that I timed the administration of our doses quite well. 

2:00am--I want to leave the rave, I can feel the effects of the mdma pretty strong now, and I just want to leave, I want to be alone with T, I don't want to be around other people and I don't want to dance, I don't want to see lights, I just want to lay down and talk. T feels like leaving too, so we hurry and leave before the mdma kicks in all the way.

2:20am--we get home and the first thing me and T do is get in bed, we talk a little bit, and we both agree that the mdma is making us want to sleep, which is very odd, I had done mdma once before and the last thing I wanted to do was sleep, it was the same feeling as the first time only not as strong, and it had a sedative effect to it for both of us, possibly because of the amanitas we had previously ingested.

3:00am--Me and T are totally quiet, just laying in bed, both awake, I had plateaued, T gets up to go to the restroom, after which she does, she begins to come down.

4:30am--T falls asleep, and I feel very very uncomfortable, feelings I had never had before nor ever wanted were rampant. I felt a recurring feeling that the inside of my brain was on fire, it didn't hurt, but it felt like my skull was under immense pressure from the inside. This really scared me because there was nothing I could do to stop whatever was happening to me. 

5:00am--The feelings continued and it was around this time that I began to hallucinate, I know that it is not too uncommon to have mild visuals while on mdma, but these were not mild visuals, I saw people running across the room, things in the ceiling, small people, all sorts of weird and scary things, I was seeing more then when I did on a previous experience with psilocybin mushrooms, this really scared me, your not supposed to hallucinate like this on either mdma or amanitas. I was really scared and I started to hyperventilate. I tried not to bug T but I was too loud and she heard me, by this time she was all the way down, and she told me just to calm down and that everything would be allright. I told her she didn't know what I was feeling and that I would not freak out if I didn't have a good reason too. It also felt like the skin on my head was being pushed out with great force, from inside my head. I couldn't do anything but lay there.

7:00am--I think I am coming down at this point, but very gradually, and the bad feelings and scary visuals continue

8:30am--I FINALLY am starting to feel normal again, and I go out of my room and use the computer

10:00am--I feel back to normal with a mild headache, T is up by now, Im glad to be alive. It was over, and Ill never fucking mix those 2 drugs again.

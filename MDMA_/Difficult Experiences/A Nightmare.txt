While it may be that the substance described is pure MDMA, Ecstasy/Molly tablets and powders are notoriously impure, misrepresented, or adulterated. Ecstasy sold in retail contexts such as festivals or parties often contain chemicals other than MDMA.] 

My experience on 2C-B was one I will honestly never forget. It started out at the club that night, I had taken 2 tabs on an empty stomach at 9:30 pm. I rolled extremely hard all night until about 4 when I came down, and decided I needed one more to get me through the day without feeling terrible. 

At the time I really cared less about what I was getting, the guy was selling purple clubs and I assumed it was mescaline so I purchased it. The tab was a lighter purple, pretty thick and a little chalky. I took it at 6:30 and didnt begin to feel effects until the car ride home at 8 in the morning. 

I could tell I was tripping in the car. When my friend and I arrived back at the apartment I felt way better than I did leaving the club. I had an extreme energy boost even though I hadnt eaten in 12 hours or slept in 24. I felt like it was going to be a great day. My friend and I both took a bong hit and took a beer to the balcony to smoke a cigarette.

Going outside set my trip way off, thats when the visuals began to kick in. Looking at the grass turning purple, I could see every blade grow, breathe, and swirl. I felt like I had microscopic vision, and was talking my friends ear off about the detail of the visuals I was having. I took a tiny sip of beer and an intense surge made my entire body spasm hard. I knew that was a mistake because the visuals had taken a stronger turn now. If I stared at anything for more than a few seconds my eyes began to burn and nothing looked familiar until I blinked. This is when I began to get scared of the intensity. I stood up and headed for the door quickly, and as soon as I opened the door the true of effects of this drug kicked in instantly. 

I looked in the mirror and my pupils were bigger than I had ever seen them in my life. The entire apartment looked as if someone had drawn it. I began to sweat profusely and immediately laid down on the couch. I started to panic because I did not know what drug I was on, and this was way more intense than any mescaline trip I ever had. I tried closing my eyes but the visuals were so much more intense than the open eye visuals. My friend watched in horror as I started to freak out. The drug had taken a dark turn in my head.

I began peaking hard. My friend said my pupils were getting larger and smaller every second, and I was feeling the same thing in my ears. The entire time I felt extremely uncomfortable, no euphoria or enlightenment. For a long time I thought I was dying, and the visuals were very dark, but my friend would say something like youre alright man, and it helped lighten up the visuals. My body was extremely sensitive to yawns or popping my ears, both made me trip hard and I avoided them if possible. The more I wondered what I was on the more I freaked out, and I needed to know what I was tripping so hard on, so I contacted my good friend who was very into the tab business. I told her what I took and she was sad to say that it was 2C-B. This eased my mind because I couldnt help think I was on something ridiculous like crystal meth or just dying in general. At this point I was much more relaxed and tried to enjoy the hardcore hallucinations I was having.

Listening to music wasnt anything special. Sounds were very distorted and not pleasant as they are on MDMA or 2C-E. The beat of the music changed the visuals somewhat like a music visualizer but it still sounded as it does sober. I had a hard time enjoying the experience as much as I tried, the drug is not nearly as glorious as 2C-E. I feel 2C-B is the drug for a talented artist. I can still remember all visuals I had and would paint everything I saw that day. The trip wore off around 6 that evening and I didnt stop having hallucinations for days after.

Being an experienced LSD, Mescaline, and 2C-E user, this was still the most intense drug I have ever come across. Fortunately I was in a controlled environment while I freaked out for the majority of my trip. Overall I would not try this drug again, but I look back and laugh at the experience.

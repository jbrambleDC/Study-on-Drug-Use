Drug background:  I first took LSD in early '92, frequently for about 3/4 of a year.  Mushrooms, a similar timeframe (just a few mos. later).  [I had to stop psychedelics for the sake of my mental health and life in banal reality] Marijuana occasionally, before acid, and a after mushrooms.  MDMA mid '93 - '00.  Other drugs as well, but none that relate to this particular account.

My boyfriend Adam, a heavy pot smoker himself, had somehow convinced me to give it another try.  I had pretty well avoided the stuff for the past 4 yrs. as it only made me feel like a pile of shit, or served to intensify trips (which I had also been avoiding).

The setting was his mother's house while she was away, one particularly beautiful summer's day in '98.  We were enjoying a gentle come-down from the previous nights E and were feeling quite positive.  We sat out on the newly constructed mini-deck/porch.  I took my 1st inhale, and remarked that I felt absolutely nothing.  I soon took a 2nd lung full. 
I stated, 'It's happening.' 

Exactly what I had hoped I would NOT experience.  The terrifying, emotional/cerebral Hell.  It shocked my brain. I felt the all-too-familiar intense panic.  The same exact feeling I had last summer, at the beginning of an insane and damaging trip.  I hadn't known for sure what had caused that episode, now it was confirmed, MDMA + THC!  I had previously warned Adam about my peculiar, possible reaction, that's why I'd said  IT'S HAPPENING...

Reality was fracturing.  To describe it ocularly, initially, it's like a transparent fractal mildly vortexing with staggered motion (like a camera aperture).  The initial feeling is that I am suddenly aware that I have just been 'gone'.   I am unaware of slipping away or being gone, only upon resurfacing does it hit me.  This increases in frequency and intensity, until there is no more surface time. 

I had made my way to his mom's king size bed, the best / most comfortable place to wait out / fight my impending ordeal.

Speech grows labored.  I feel sooo far away.   Away  from 'reality'.  
Nothing could comfort/distract/keep me, not even Adam's attempt by mentioning my dearly loved kitten. 
I feel the thousand+ veils of the thousand+ levels of reality/consciousness.  

Soon, my brain is melting. It feels like what I imagine 100 hits of acid would do, maybe more.  ime - why does it have to move so painfully slowly?  A few minutes feel like an hour! I am now having to exert everything I can muster to prevent my mind from slipping away...permanently.  It feels like physical labor (I may have been clinging to the bed sheets).  For a second, I lessen my tenacity, my mind slips dangerously away. No! It would be devastating!  I worry that I won't 'come back'.  And expect that fate now.   I will have to be institutionalized.  My empty shell will sit there for the rest of its days, drooling, and having its butt wiped for it - a vegetable.  Adam is on the phone in another room - with the sanitarium?  Oh, how this will kill my mother.   My small, broken family will be shamed.  They'll never understand.

This experience is proof.  Proof of other space-time dimensions.  OK, enough!  I believe already!  I had been convinced by my previous psychedelic travels with LSD / mushrooms.   They are 'keys'.  So is (percussive) music.  

Although I find it difficult to discern if I do, in fact, need to go (I eventually just figure I should give it a try), surprisingly, I'm able to make it to the washroom.  I urinate frequently and in significant amounts.  How is this possible?  I haven't had a drink in many hours.  What is the correlation?

After many (8?) hours of this mental meltdown, I finally felt some relief.   But feel psychologically/emotionally worse for wear, for some time afterwards.  Adam never understood what happened to me.

My next such episode wouldn't be 'til NewYear's 2000...

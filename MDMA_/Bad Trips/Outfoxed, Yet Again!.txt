My brother managed to get some Research Chemicals, Foxy Methoxy and 4-HO-MET,  and sent them to me to try.

Xavier and I decided to try Foxy first as this weekend is our anniversary weekend, and we thought it would be a good idea to spice up our sex life a bit. We are two gay guys madly in love, and we like having sex on ecstasy. The combination of MDEA by IM injection and a tablet of MDMA is our favourite time-honoured concoction, so we thought we would still use that, plus add only just a little bit of Foxy to add a touch of erotic psychedelia to the experience. Being very familiar with Ketamine, our favourite psychedelic material, which, in small quantities, can be used to add a touch of psychedelia to an MDMA trip, we actually thought it would work a bit like that with Foxy, too. I also thought that the basic platform of comfort and well being established by the MDEA+MDMA combination should override any possible adverse feelings from the unknown drug. Unfortunately, all this reasoning was rather flawed as the report below will demonstrate. 

T+ 0:00 
We both injected MDEA and consumed a tablet of good quality ecstasy. 

T+ 0:15 
MDEA was well felt and gave us a nice buzz. We chitchatted and waited for the MDMA tablet to also kick in.

T+ 1:30
This promises to be a very nice e-trip indeed. Very lovey dovey, sexually charged. We hugged and kissed for half an hour, and then decided to take Foxy, the idea being that we will only take very little to start with and then increase the dosage carefully, until we reach the optimum feeling, just like we would do that with Ketamine. I was to try it on myself first, then, based on that, work out a suitable dosage for Xavier.

T+ 2:00
I decided to apply Foxy by IM injection, to bypass the stomach upset and nausea problems I read about in other reports. This has proven to be the correct method, as no stomach problems were observed by either of us. I started with a careful 2mg initial dose, bearing in mind my last experience with another Research Chemical, 2C-C, where I ended up convulsing in bed for over an hour, unable to find a single comfortable position for my battered body. I was determined to be extra cautious
this time and not let a similar experience happen to me again. Little did I know that I was heading towards something much worse, as a result of some major mistakes I was just about to make.

T+ 2:20
I felt nothing after the first 2mg, so I gave myself another 2mg.

T+ 2:40
I started feeling a little inebriated; this was pleasant and I felt this was enhancing the already considerable high I was feeling on the MDEA+MDMA combination.

T+ 3:00
Still nothing unusual happening; just that growing feeling of inebriation, no visuals or other psychedelic effects. I added 2 mg, then, when after yet another half an hour I still felt the same, I added another 2 mg. I now felt waves of sexual energy rushing through my crotch. Good!

T+ 3:30
Finally something different started to happen. There was a funny taste in my mouth, and I also started to experience some closed-eye visuals. Unfortunately, at the same time, a perceptible load suddenly descended on my chest, which, as I learnt from the past with cocaine and 2C-C meant only one thing: tachycardia. The feeling could be probably best described as that you'd get if you drank 100 cups of coffee. I could not
actually feel my pulse at that time (the inebriation was strong enough to mask it, or perhaps the MDEA+MDMA was still having an analgesic effect), but the growing feeling of tension on the left side of my chest started to bother me, so I decided this was to be my limit. Unfortunately, this was already too late. The three major mistakes I made are as follows:

1. I failed to realize that it may take much more than 20 minutes for the effects to reach their peak and by that time, the unpleasant body load may increase disproportionally.

2. I failed to appreciate that what may seem tolerable for 10 minutes or so may become a major nuisance if one has to endure it for 5 hours.

3. The idea of using MDMA as an safety net, supposedly preventing a bad trip, works well for me with low-body-load short-duration drugs like Ketamine, where it really does provide a feel-good starting base from which a bad trip is rare, and moreover prevents me from falling into the K-hole too soon, effectively straightening the dose-to-response curve. But with high body load drugs that last much longer, once the soothing effect of the MDMA wears out, I was left with a body load much heavier than what I thought I was originally starting with.

But before I knew all this, Xavier now wanted to try some Foxy too, so I gave him 2mg first, and then increased the dosage gradually for him until he said stop. He asked me to stop after 8mg where he was starting to feel he was 'losing himself' and wanted to keep 'sober' in order for us, as we then hoped, to have fantastic sex. 

T: 4:00 
I am starting to realize I have overdosed. But only overdosed in terms of body load; my mind was perfectly clear, in fact clearer now as the effect of MDEA+MDMA was starting to wear off, and Foxy was now  completely taking over. Meanwhile, Xavier seemed to enjoy this drug. He was very horny and demanded sex. I measured my heart rate: 130 per minute. I measured Xavier's: 72 per minute. At any time throughout the night, Xavier's heart rate did not exceed 80 per minute. Two guys with almost the same dosage, yet such different effects. But of course, I am 55, he is only 35; why do I need to be reminded of my age yet again? 

I felt a rising sense of bodily discomfort combined with mental anxiety, but at the same time I did not want to alarm Xavier who seemed to be having a good time. I suggested that I take the passive sex role, as I was afraid to do anything to increase my heart rate yet further. For a while, this was actually extremely pleasurable, and I even managed to temporarily distract myself from the still growing feeling of stress in my chest. Another good thing was that this made Xavier tired and, after a while, his mind seemed to drift away, probably exploring some closed-eye visuals. This gave me some much needed respite to be able to have a rest and concentrate on what was happening to myself. I briefly considered taking another MDEA/MDMA to calm myself down, but with my heart rate still at 130, I decided against it, probably wisely so.

T: 5:30
My heart rate is now 125 per minute. I know that Foxy is longer lasting than 2C-C (whose ordeal was over in just over an hour), and I am bracing up for the inevitable fact that I will need to cope with the heavy feeling of unbearable pressure in my chest, where every single breath requires an effort compared to pushing up a load of bricks and where my heart is racing like crazy, possibly for another two hours. It was to be four. At some stage, I started to perceive a little synesthesia  (confusion of senses), which was similar to 2C-C. But while the 'taste' of 2C-C was that of freshly crushed aluminium, the 'taste' and 'smell' of Foxy was that of old rotting jute cargo bags. 

T:+ 9:30
This must have been the most horrible 4 hours of my life. The feeling of claustrophobic hopelessness and anxiety, combined with unbearable bodily discomfort, eventually inevitably gave rise to a case of psychosis: I was angry. Angry with myself that I (again) allowed myself to get into this situation. Angry with my machoid straight brother who would one day crave for a hug from me, yet the second day deny that and freak out from the very idea. Angry with the world's Christians, Muslims and Jews that have fucked up this world to make it so unliveable. Angry with us atheists who have equally failed to inspire with our
depressive nihilism. And then again angry with myself, an ageing queen who once wanted to reach for the stars - and ended up grabbing this shitty drug instead.

Xavier seemed to be still drifting in lalaland, and I quietly walked out of the bedroom. I decided to walk around the house, in the vain hope that this will get the drug out of my system faster. The house was also colder than the bedroom, so I was hoping this might calm me down and maybe bring my heart rate down. I must have been walking around the house, in circles, for about an hour. 

I did not notice that, meanwhile, Xavier found that I was no longer in the bedroom, and went to look for me in the house. He could not find me, and in the dark house got scared, under the influence of the drug. When I finally remembered to go back and check on him, I found him coiled on the bed in the fetal position, frightened. He said he got scared with me not around, but felt helpless to do something  about it, which in turn got him scared even more. He also said he was already getting fed up with the 'feeling'; when is it going to end? But then he regained composure very quickly, and suggested having sex again. 

This time he wanted me to fuck him, but I was obviously in no position to do so, having just spent the last few hours trying to hold on dear life. I said I was too tired and suggested that we go to sleep. He reluctantly agreed, but neither of us could actually sleep. He was tossing and turning, while I was just trying to keep calm as much as possible and so patiently survive the rest of the night, where every minute seemed like eternity.

T:+ 11:30
My heart rate dropped to 100 and the feeling of heavy discomfort has been partially lifted off my chest. Miraculously, I managed to fall asleep. 

T:+ 13:30
I woke up 2 hours later, myself and my half of the bed drenched in sweat. My heart rate is still 100.

T:+ 15:30
It's noon already. Xavier says that it is impossible for him to sleep and gets out of bed. Me also. I start typing this report in order to put myself back into some sort of normalcy again. My heart rate is now 90, still well above my resting 60. There is still a feeling of tension on the left side of my chest, which seems to shoot up my neck and chin. There is also a dull pain at the back of my head and a slight dizziness partially still due to the vaning effect of the drug and partially by sheer tiredness and lack of sleep. No other problems apart from feeling thoroughly physically and emotionally drained. I think I am finally on the mend, but given the slow speed with which the drug seems to be leaving my system, I feel it might take me the rest of the day, if not more, to fully recover.

SUMMARY:
Chemically, 2C-C and Foxy are about as apart in the 'Research Chemical' spectrum as one can get. Yet, the only difference with which my body reacted to them was the length of the experience, which was much longer with Foxy. Even the visuals were similar: stripes and patterns of bright neon colours, in a kinda Disney or Hollywood cheap and kitchy style. As I am accustomed to the intricate visuals and profound feelings one experiences on Ketamine, I found this aspect disappointing. In both cases, I was far too distracted by the heavy body load to be able to appreciate the psychedelics. Or rather, the heavy body load came along much earlier before the psychedelics had any chance to properly kick in and become worthy of my interest.

Xavier and I have reacted vastly differently to drugs. On the whole, Xavier enjoyed it, only eventually complaining that it lasted too long and that he could not sleep.

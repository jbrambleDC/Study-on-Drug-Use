This day started off as any normal day. I had gone by my friend Ryan's work to see how he was doing. We chilled there for a bit then he asked me what are you doing tonight. I said man we can do whatever you want. He said 'Well man I'll call you and you can come over to my brothers house, we are going to get messed up over there tonight.' I thought to myself damn its going to be one of those nights. Little did I know what kind of night I was getting myself into. Me and my friend Ryan had been talking about doing acid for about a month now. I told him that I have done shrooms and it was great. His older brother Shawn said he had done acid, but it had been almost 3 years since. I was at my house when Ryan called on this Friday night, he said man you will never guess what I got, Acid he replied. 'Get your ass over here,' he said. I went over there that night, that was the biggest mistake I've ever made.

When I walked through the door Ryan handed me a six pack of beer. I drank five of them in about 30 min then out came the acid. I was very scared to take it, I kept thinking damn I have heard some bad shit about this, but I thought oh well who cares, so I took two hits, along with Shawn and Ryan. Directly after that this girl said I have some KB (kind Bud) lets smoke. I was all up for that , we hit that bong countless times. I would say somewhere around 8-10 each. It had been about 40 min since I had taken the acid. Around 10:10 pm I started to see tracers and just felt great. There was a girl named Laura with Shawn she knew of all these little cool things to do to enhance the trip. Things like reach for the devil, and running through the forest. How was I to know I would soon to be right with the devil. There were 7 people there, 3 of which I had just yet met. One of the girls pulled out about 25 tabs of X and I was like of man I have got to do one of them. At this time I was feeling the effects of the acid way over the weed and alcohol. I took one exctasy tab and waited for the effects from that. About 30 min after that tab I took one more, then another, then me and Ryan snorted one.

About 15 min after that, the feeling I had was the best thing I have ever felt. The acid made me see life in a whole new perspective. I could hear every little peep throughout the condo we were in. All colors were awesome to me. I just wanted to touch everything. I was like a little lost 3 year old in a new world. The 3 people I did not know stayed in the kitchen most of the time. Shawn , Ryan and I sat in the living room trying to describe what we were feeling. I could slowly start to feel a funny feeling. The sounds were starting to bother me and then the very sight of people started to mess with my mind. I remember people coming up and asking are you cool man, I thought they were all after me trying to hurt me. I just wanted to be alone. I went and asked someone is this what happens on this shit (acid), they said man trust me its the acid taken effect. While that girl told me that I was looking over her shoulder at a picture with a man holding a fork and a plate. His eyes were red with blood so I turned away just walking away from this girl while she talked to me.

At that point I could not talk to anyone or look at them. Everyones eyes would fill up with blood and then run down there face. The blood would come out from their noses and mouths also. I could not believe this was happening. Everywhere I looked I saw blood. I got out of that room trying to be by myself, I just wanted to be alone. The visual images I saw were so horrific that I honestly am in chills right now and my eyes are filled with tears, I am being serious. I am not tying to add drama so dont think that. Anyway back to the story. I saw my friend Shawn lying on the couch, I crawled towards him on the floor so he could not see me, I was afraid he would try to grab me. As I peeked over the couch I saw Shawn gasping for air and then the blood came from his eyes and mouth again like before , I wanted to help him , he was suffering, but I was to scared to reach out and touch him. I jumped up and ran for help 'I said Shawns dying to everyone' they came running and looked at me and said man Shawns fine dude, he taking a nap chill out. The acid made me see horrible things. I kept trying to get Ryan to stay close because I did not want him to die. Then I knew everyone was going to kill me. I honestly can say that I saw the devil he talked to me while I sat in the chair in the living room. He was covered in blood. He was telling me I would be here for ever I could not respond to him I was in shock and torment. I really wanted to die right then.

Everyone was in the kitchen and I was the only one in the living room. Ryan said that I was freaking out so bad that nobody could stand to be around me, I just thought they were in there planning a way to kill me and hide my body. I tried to compose myself and watch TV. Bad mistake, I just saw people dying, blood, death, Satan, knives, sharp objects, look the best way to put it is that was having the most evil, and supernatural experience possible. It was probably 4 in the morning when Ryan got me stable enough to go up stairs and try to sleep, key word, TRY. I went in that room and sat the rest of the morning on the floor praying to God to end this for me, I prayed to God that if he would make it all stop then I would never do anything again ever. For the next 5 hours I laid there feeling things touch me all over, where I was laying on the floor was a huge pile of sweet and tears. I cried so much but I was so afraid to be loud because I thought the evil would hear me and come up to get me. I was left alone in that room to cope with the terror and depression by myself for 5 hours. I never said one word the whole time I was in there.

Since that happened 3 weeks ago I have found God , I have not even smoked a cigarette or touched one drug or anything bad since. I dont want to do anything ever again. This experience cause me to lock all my doors during the day, I check behind doors and I have to keep all the lights on in the house at night. I have been over to Shawns apartment 10 or so times since that night but I am so afraid to be there, I feel a strange presence in that condo. I feel like all his pictures are still looking at me and they know what happened that night. I couldn't be alone at night for the first week afterwards. I asked Ryan if he would talk on the phone at night along with various other people, they did and I thank them for it , because I would not have made it with out them. That was my first and last time with acid. I should not have mixed so many hard drugs together. I felt the effects of the acid for two days later. 

My advice to people wanting to try acid is that I wouldn't do it, although everyones body reacts differently, and I just had a bad, bad trip. Acid will take you to places you have never seen so I am not saying dont try it, just know from my experience what could happen. I am a changed man since that night, that truly was a night I spent with the devil.

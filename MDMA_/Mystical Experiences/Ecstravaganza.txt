A friend of mine had just got a shipment of multiple MDMA pills in and invited me to a rolling party at his house.  I jumped on the offer and arrived at about 9 pm.  It was all hugs and love in the air, as the countless people already there were more than likely rolling.  

I purchased 3 tabs, intending to leave it at that for my evening.  1 purple christmas tree, 1 white music note, and 1 red apple.  I popped the red apple and walked into the dance area smiling as I passed by the dj spinning a nice house mix.  I encountered a group of good friends who had just arrived and showed them the way to the pills.

45 minutes later, we are all rolling and loving it.  This particular pill had me rolling for about an hour, and I began to doubt its intensity.  I decide to pop my white music note in the bathroom and go back for more dancing.  Upon the come up of this tab, I close my eyes and realize that I am tripping extremely hard!  I see whole galaxies of lights and the feeling of being at a rave with my CEV's and the music in the background overcomes me. The body sensations are very nice.  I am loving it.

We all hang out, dance, smoke weed, the usual rolling stuff for another hour and a half or so and I pop my purple christmas tree.  An hour passes and it is not doing it for me.  I decide to buy some more ecstasy.  I buy another white music note and a white maple leaf.  Having already taken a music note, I take the maple leaf.  This hits me and I'm speed crazy!  I'm 'rolling dick' as my friends like to say. 

I have not heard much about this, but everytime I roll lately, I am tripping hardcore.  Moreso on the visual and audio levels, as well as the normal body sensations.  Back to the story... We walk outside to enjoy cigarettes and conversations.  Awww, yes... bonding.  We decide to go on one of our routine (yet not very smart) rolling drives complete with blasting music and conversations.  [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  It has been about two hours since the come up of my last tab and I decide to take two more tabs before our drive.  I know, I know, I abuse the hell out of this shit (not recommended!).  The problem is I only have my music note left... Hmmmm, let's buy two more!  I purchase another maple leaf and a yellow thumb's up.  I pop the music note and thumb's up, and save the maple leaf for later, with the knowledge of it being a speedy pill.  

We begin our drive and blast some indie music (I enjoy indie and post-rock more than techno while rolling for some reason).  We are all bobbing our heads, singing along, and smiling as we reach the downtown area.  I look at the sidewalks and notice that I am seeing people walking that turn out to be nothing at all.  WHOA!  I'm in a whole different dimension.  Possibly MDA in some of the pills, who knows?  [Erowid Note: While it may be that the substances described in the report are MDA and Amphetamines, Ecstasy tablets are notoriously impure or misrepresented, often containing chemicals other than those they are presumed to contain. This report is marked as an MDMA report, but readers should be aware that this is more of a general Ecstasy report.]   The two pills hit me and all audio sinks into the background as my vision becomes extremely blurred.  My eyes are jittering all over and I am in what I called 'my name here-land'.  I close my eyes and get crazier closed eye visuals than I have ever had on any other drug.  I'm talking people doing aerobics, bright and happy winding roads with blue birds flying above, as well as complicated multi-colored light designs similar to those that you would see at a rave.  

We all exit the car in the parking lot of the boardwalk which has a nice scenic view of the lake.  My euphoria is so intense that I can't open my eyes.  We walk to the lake to talk and we are all very happy and enjoying life.  I ask if anyone else is tripping and all but one says they are not.  I'm glad that it happens to be my best friend who says he is tripping as well, and he tells me he sees similar things to what I am saying.  Euphoria is at amazing levels and I cannot believe it!  My girlfriend gives me a massage and I return the favor, all while enjoying the beatiful view of the downtown lights cascading on the lake.  

We decide to go back to the party.  It has died down, and my roll has a bit too.  I take the the maple leaf and we all sit down for a good smoke.  This pill hits me and I am still tripping so extremely hard.  The weed intensifies everything, as usual.  I am to the point where I am trying to socialize but I forget what I am saying half way through the sentence.  This made a nice laugh.  I am properly fried and decide to play super mario on SNES.  I will not sleep until I conquer the game, which I did easily within 2 hours.  I still cannot sleep, and most everyone except the house owner and a few stragglers are dreaming by now.  

We hang out and let our rolls coast off until beautiful sleep does arrive.  The next morning, I feel like I am dreaming.  The whole day goes by and I feel like an absolute zombie.  The next couple of days are a bit better but not normal.  I have since decided to not ingest more than 3 ecstasy pills in one night due to the terrible hangover.

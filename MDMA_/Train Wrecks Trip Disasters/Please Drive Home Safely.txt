  One night my fiance and I decided to go to a small rave up on top of a beautiful mountain.  The town that we live in is pretty small, so most of our parties end up being outdoors, which I think is quite condusive to a spiritual experience.  We arrived just as the party had gotten underway.  We had some MDMA, and proceeded to ingest one pill each.  It was about 11:00pm, I guess.  As time went by the party got better and better, we were both rolling pretty good.  After dancing for a while we went off to the side, under a huge pine tree, to smoke a bowl.  A girl I didn't know came up just to chat with us, and we offered to smoke with her, which made her very happy!  

  Anyway, around 2:00 we took our second pill, and the rest of the night is kind of a blur.  I remember seeing an older man, around 60 or so, who looked like he was not having a good time.  I went up to him and asked if he was ok, putting my hand on his stomach.  He looked at me funny, and said, 'You know, I am having some stomach pains tonight, right where you put your hand.'  I smiled.  He told me his name was Planet.  After we chatted a bit, I went back to dancing.  My fiance and I must have gone to bed (in the back of our pick-up that had a camper shell) around 4 or 5 am.  We woke up around 7 am, actually my fiance woke up, and I remained in the back of the truck while he went up front to drive us back into town because I had to be at work by 8 am.  I remember waking up sometime during the drive to ask him what time it was, then I went back to sleep.

  The next thing I woke up to was chaos.  There was a tremendous noise, and I was extremely disoriented, I was being flung about like a rag doll, then I heard another huge BANG! and then all I saw was ceiling-floor-ceiling-floor.  I still feel my heart race when I think about the screams. There was one point when I was sure that this was *it* for me, and I will never forget that moment.  When all movement finally stopped, I was dazed, and my fiance climbed through the little window that connects the cab and the bed of the truck.  'What happened?' I asked.  'We got into an accident,' he replied.  Then I said, 'I can't feel my legs,' and then he began to cry.  I saw blood on his hands and forehead, and I was very concerned for him.  He told me not to move.  That's when I finally realized that I was *fucked* up, and the scariest part now was the quiet...we were down in a ravine, and we thought no one would know where we were.  But then, joy upon joy, we heard a voice from up on the highway call down to us, 'Are you alright?' We both replied in unison, 'No!!'  Evevntually he got someone with a cell phone to call an ambulance, and let me tell you, when those sirens are coming for you, there is no sweeter sound in the world.  Right then I knew I was going to live.  

  How did the accident happen?  I bet you can guess - he fell asleep at the wheel.  The truck went off the road at 60 mph.

  After the paramedics put us on stretchers, they used the lamp post we had taken out on the way down to help slide us out of the ravine.  I was taken to our small hospital, which decided that my injuries were to serious for them to handle, so I was airlifted to a bigger town about 300 miles away.  To make a long story somewhat shorter, I broke three ribs, punctured my right lung, twisted two vertabre in my neck, and crushed or cracked about four in my back.  That last injury is the one that made me a paraplegic last Sept.  I have recovered nicely, and am able to laugh, something I thought I would never be able to do again.

My fiance got away with just a few scratches, thankfully.  I have since forgiven him, in fact I never really blamed him at all, but I told him I forgave him because he needed to hear it to be able to  forgive himself.

I'd like to make it clear that I am not against using MDMA.  In fact, I have used it since my accident and find it to be very theraputic.  What I am against is using it irresponsibly.  If you go somewhere to party that you have to drive home from, please, be sure that you are coherent and have had enough sleep.  And *always* wear your seatbelt.  Your life (or lifestyle, in my case) may depend on it.

9:57 EST I take a seat comfortably on my cousins blue tile floor. I used this empty office room because it is quiet and gives off a good feel. I lift my makeshift light bulb pipe near my mouth. I use my sisters PINK lighter, of all things. Before I take the hit, there is much contemplation through my head. It seems I was not worried about a bad trip but just excited that I was about to immerse myself into one of the most powerful, visual, and mind altering trips of my life. 

The start: I take first hit, I taste a very chemical like smoke. I rest the bulb and lighter down. I begin to feel very tactile as I sit and as if I am almost there if that is possible to say.

I think to myself  Okay now a big one

I take my second hit. A large inhalation which I swallow the smoke and close my eyes.

I wrote down first on my scratch paper soul ascent It seemed as if my soul began to be pulled upwards out of me by a divine force, the ironic thing is what happens next. The ground beneath me began to shake as if like an earthquake. My body felt as if it wanted to move down, or it was being sucked. The blue tile beneath me shattered into pieces with glistening edges. As if I was the Rainman, I counted each and every piece as fast as the ground broke.

I began to fall with the shards of tile down further and further until I saw a white light in the dark. For some reason the light seemed to have 1 large beam going down. It had a swirling darkness in the center of orb of light. As I watched the center I felt as if I had just landed on my posterior as if I fell into a pool. I look down to see the same tiles I had been sitting on, remade into the same square of the room I was in. The ground Tile beneath began to sink as I looked left and right. Only I did not sink with it. I was sitting on water. The water was completely calm, pitch black, and unmoving, I could see the reflection of the light above me as if it was a mirror. As I sat on the water I felt no moisture. I began to look up there was no longer darkness. It seemed as if the sky was I wrote down plagued by shapes. Now that I look back it was not plagued but more over covered in the shapes which had 8 shapes, however it was not like a textbook it was 8 sided in the similar shape of a diamond. The edges reflected different colors fading in and out. It seemed as if the cosmos were within them, different galaxies into a divine plane is what seemed to come into my head. 

As this thought came into my head I heard the sound of what seemed like waves crashing. I begin to look down to the endless ocean I have taken a seat on. The calmness is broken by quiet mellow ripples. The ripples speak to me as they move, slowly crashing against my feet. They tell me, I wrote down waves say where will you go.  The ripples asked where I would go. I looked up to the sky, the shapes changed into what seemed like squares, but I could not get over that these squares had sides which would change in and out of different zigzags or circling vortexes. I did not use words to reply to the ocean. I looked up and focused my sight to the most mellow one which was off the right of me. This shape constantly changed, within in it was a whole new world. I began to feel as if my body became connected with a higher soul. My body began to be pulled forcefully as if I plunged into this shape at light speed. Around me was a tunnel of changing shapes identical to the one I had plunged through. I felt myself come out the other end of it. I wrote end of plane travel. This does not mean that I was by any means traveling on an airplane. But traveling on a plane of the soul, like the astral, etheric or divine. 

As I began to stand on top of nothing, I stared into the cluster of stars in front of me. The stars seemed more like I wrote down pieces of creation. To me the stars were orbs of white light connected by lines of crystal clear forming an exquisite wall of  pieces of  creation'. It was one of the most beautiful geometric works of art. Even if the darkest room of infinite space, there was a comfort in watching it. Next I felt as if my mind became connected with each of these light orbs amongst this wall. Everything became bright. I could not close my eyes. 

I look at the digital clock in front of me. It seems as if its numbers are moving in and out, as if I am frying on well over 700 micrograms. Everything around me seems to be moving up and down for the couple seconds I snapped out of the trip. I see the pen, I brought it here for a reason I thought. I began jotting down bullet points of thing to remind me of this experience. Next, I tried to move my leg in to stand up. As I tried it would not move. I felt as if I commanded it, and it denied me movement. After taking a deep breath and waiting a few seconds. I stood up. I quickly crashed my posterior into the leather chair and thought with my pen in hand. I wrote down connection of mind and soul last. I sat in the chair looking around the room, convinced that I was frying, some things seemed completely normal, while others seemed as if they did what they wanted to. The cable box unplugged seemed to flash at me every now and then, as if it was on. After observing some awkward objects, I next walked over to the couch and crashed on the soft leather. I seemed to feel high but not a smiling high. Just a heady high. This high lasted quite long. 

This DMT experience has showed me a higher conscious, and a side of the human mind that exists to those who seek it. DMT has showed me a universal connection of the soul, mind, and body, to the universe and time. It is an experience that liberates the mind into a new state of thought and a new conscious.

I have had much experience in the realm of the unknown. DMT had opened many doors in the past... or is it the future, I sometimes forget. At any rate, that doesn't matter much right now. It was around 12pm, the sun was in full view, and the wind was gently blowing through the window, the fans catching the breeze. I was ready.

T -24hr

I had fasted for 24 hours, drinking only water, and excercising moderately over those hours, and sleeping for a full 7 hours.

T -5hr

I drank a lot of water early in the morning and went for a walk to prepare my conciousness for the journey I was about to go on.

T - 10min

I packed my handmade inline perc, with a rather large pinch of Salvia extract. I have had a select few experiences with it before, and had rather profound visions of alternate realities. The DMT packed on top was fresh, made a couple days before by a friend from M.Hostilis. It was a clear/yellow shard, and very dense. I prepared myself by putting on a DNA activation mp3, which was a very dull tonal synth melody. 

T - 5min

I stripped down to my boxers, to avoid any potential constriction whilst rolling around.

T- 2min

I sat on my bed, meditating for a time. Finally, once I was in the zone, I put the screen over the bowl so as to not burn that beautiful DMT crystal. 

T +/- 0

I exhaled deeply, and sparked the bowl. I slowly pulled, Taking care to fully expand my lungs. With the tube cashed, I sat it down on the floor and layed back, whilst holding my breath. 

T + 30sec

I lost the ability to see the material world almost immediately, and was sucked into the bed, enveloped by a technicolour web of energy and light. It was soon replaced with what I would call dark matter. A black hole was swallowing me, swirling and enveloping the universe from where I had been blasted off. I had become a singularity, if only for a glimpse of a second.

T + 1min

The feeling of dark pressure had finally torn me apart, I was no longer in my physical vessel. I had become an interweaving series of these multi coloured tubes, which formed into a great machine of sorts. I drifted away from my own soul, as those I were becoming something more... or like I was being reconstructed. I awoke, and I was in a morgue? It was more like a research labratory, everything was white, Immaculate. These pulsating sounds, like a piledriver, were rhythmically breathing.

T + 3min

I became aware of the situation. My face was in front of a screen. I was inside a casket? or a drawer of sorts. I was not breathing, I was back in material form. Naked. I am freezing. I realized the situation as I saw metallic tubes sticking out of my every joint, pumping a metallic crystal substance into my lifeless body... Am I dreaming? What the hell is this? I forced the drawer open, pulling the tubes out of my body.

I was not expected to wake up, was I?

I jump out, only to find an infinite number of all of these drawers. They were neatly aligned, like a library. They had humans, humanoids, outright monsters, and beings that I just couldn't begin to understand, and all of them were in the catatonic state I had previously been in. It was just beyond my comprehension. Immediately, I came to the conclusion I was not supposed to be standing up, awake. 

Where am I?

How did I get here?

What is the meaning of this?

Immediately, a voice jumps into my thoughts, explaining that this is where you go when you fall asleep. All of the races go there. Together, in their slumber, their thoughts intertwine, intermingle, to form the web I would best understand as the multiverses. The voice explained that our collective conciousness is what keeps the multiverse in existance. 

It was horrible. We are enslaved in our sleep, harvested to allow this garganttuan machine made out of glass and light to pump all of our energy around at high speeds. I ran. I knew exactly where to go. I found the tremendous disk. It was silver, and solid to the touch. I pushed on it slightly, and it bounced back, resonating my own voice. It asked me why I wanted to escape, if I knew the implications of returning with this knowledge. I didn't care. Do what thou wilt. That is the power of man. I pushed through, I jumped sooooo slowly. Finally, as I flew through this tunnel with alternating perpendicular rungs of a ladder, they slid this way and that, forcing me to take alternate routes. It seemed as though I never had a choice in the matter. 

T + 15min

I opened my eyes and I was naked, staring at myself in the mirror in my bathroom at home. How did I end up here? Where was this place? Was I really just in my head? My eyes were flickering different colors, they were phasing through a rainbow, finally settling at silver blue for a time... Which is odd because my eyes are normally honey brown. I was sweating profusely. I ran to my notepad, and scribbled down a little drawing of what I saw and what you read right now. My radio was not playing what I had set it to. It had a faint voice coming from it, very distorted and synthesized. It was mumbling things that I will never repeat. 

T + 22min

I am finally back to baseline. The afterglow from this is mind numbing. I am coughing up weird dry chunky white stuff... what is this? I am very very parched. I am starving. 

T + 25min

I am back. This place is so strange. So pointless. We all need to set aside our differences, our greed, our anger. We need to live in a state of love, rythm, joy. I hope one day we will all wake up, and smash that fucking dream machine. It is a trap. It is there to enslave our energy. We should be in control of our own souls, our own destiny. Collectively as a race, and separately. No more war. I am not afraid of death, but I truely appreciate the beauty of life quite a bit more. 

I may further experiment, but the lessons I learned internally are so profound I think I may take a break from tryptimines.

Namaste

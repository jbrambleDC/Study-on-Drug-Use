One day I was coming off the peak of a 2C-E trip and I wanted to see how some n,n,DMT would go with it. I have done each substance by its self a good number of times and enjoy them both very much by themselves. My 2C-E trip was going very well nice feeling visuals ect. I put 33mgs of n,nDMT (This is the amount it takes me to have a good break though when I lie down and relax) on some tin foil and inhaled it in 2 good sized tokes and laid down. 

The next thing I remember being in a strange trance similar to a Salvia trance, it didnt feel good so I pulled myself out of it and remembed I had smoked DMT. The visuals were very strange I saw DMT visuals but they seem to conflict with the 2C-E. Thnigs became warped, twisted and mean. Through out the whole DMT experience I had a negative uncomfortable feeling. As the DMT wears off I started to lose the uncomfortable feeling. Usually I love everything about a DMT experience but not mixed with 2C-E. I dont think these chemicals mix well, not for me anyway.

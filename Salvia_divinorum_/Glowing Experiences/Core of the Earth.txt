This was not my first time smoking Salvia. I had quite a few occasions where not much occurred, nothing but lightheadedness and skin sensitivity. Many of my friends have tried it, and said it is just a 'different high'. But I knew there was much more to it, and decided to try it again. I had never done any hard drugs like LSD or mushrooms, only marijuana. 

So one day, I pulled out my bag of the 5x extract I purchased and sprinkled it into my pipe then I put on my headphones and listened to some music. I held the first hit for about 10 seconds because I had to cough very hard. Then I take another hit, holding it in for a good 30 seconds, feeling it begin to kick in a little before I let the smoke out. So I fell onto my bed and all of a sudden, I felt a strange tingle on my side that I was lying on. Things appeared normal in the room, yet I had the sensation of sinking into the ground. So I closed my eyes, and I could see brown-colored gears rotating. I seemed to be rotating downward counter-clockwise, and I could see my room above, lifting upward away from me. I was going into the ground. I didn't want to open my eyes at this point, I didn't even think about it really. This 'underground' I was going into, was pitch black. All I could see were the brown gears, rotating me into this black abyss. Somebody was down there, a being was making these gears work. I pointed up to the room I was slowly going away from and remember saying to this invisible being with a little laughter that he had forgotten to take something else from up there, yet it was ignored. The room above was drifting away from me and I didn't care.

Then it began to close off. My rotation stopped at a weird angle, yet I was still going down. I began to see surface of this 'underground', a rocky hard dirty surface, yet I never landed on it, I continued going down, watching the surface disappear. Below it were more gears, more in quantity, in a much wider range. And I kept going down all of these 'underground floors' like I was in an elevator. There was a bright light at the bottom, where all moving stopped, like I had reached the bottom floor of a building. This light was like the sun, a glowing orb with a light red color. I had reached the core of the Earth and invisible beings were all around me. I felt them there, and I heard faint whispers. I took this harshly and accused them of mocking me for being new to this 'underground'. Yet all anger passed. And I felt like I was one of them, I laughed a few times, thinking it was all too great to belong here. The beings were omnipresent and unseen, and it was unclear what exactly we were doing down here. But I didn't care, I relaxed, feeling like I was at my new home.

I don't know what happened after that, it seemed like I awoke from a dream, but I was unsure when it actually ended. Could have been right there, but I felt like there was more to it.

I had never had any experience like this before. I did feel a little good afterwards but it faded away to normal after a few hours, like my feelings inside the 'core' stayed inside me and then realized I was no longer there after long delay. I sort of missed that place for a few days, I wanted to go back there and feel that way again.

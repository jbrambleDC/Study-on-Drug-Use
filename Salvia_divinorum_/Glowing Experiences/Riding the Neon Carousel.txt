Mind set: Over the past year I had been studying Salvia online for a while. I made sure I knew the plant enough before I wanted to try it. The night finally came where I was going to try salvia. I drove to my friends house. I was a little bit nervous to try it. Also I was extreamly excited. I tried to block out anything negative in my head becuase I knew I definitly did not want a bad trip. 

Setting: My friends basement. Mr. Bungle is playing from the playstation. The room is brightly lit. I am sitting on a couch. The room has punching bags and holes in the walls from when we used to throw knives at them. The place looks like a Chinies dojo. With me on my trip are my friends 'R' and 'M.' We had no sitter. My friend R breaks off a marajuana stem to use as a platform in his glass pipe so the Extract does not fall out. R took his hit and passed the pipe to me. I put the pipe to my mouth. 

The Experience: I inhaled the smoked and held it deep in my lungs for about 10 seconds. I blew the smoke out and started to buzz. M took his hit. I began to stare at the wall in front of me. A hallway then appeared in front of me going all the way to the wall. This hallway spun around on its axis. I then noticed that there was an increase in gravity. Neon colors raced by. 

That's when the most messed up thing I have ever experianced happened. I reached out toward the wall. A trail of hands we left behind my hand as it moved around. I then ripped open the wall. Right then and there I had ripped open the very fabric of the universe. Behind the rip in the wall there was only blackness. 

That subsided quickly. His wall then turned from white to blue. I looked up to M to explain what I was feeling but I said 'Check out these tunnels.' I don't know why I said that but as soon as I said that I began moving my hands towards the wall and scooping out the air creating tunnels. These tunnels transformed into a monorail system like the one in Orlando Florida. I rode the monorails and then noticed that the pillow resting on my stomach felt like it weighed about 300 pounds. I soon forgot about the pillow and looked over to M. he was staring at my foot. 

'James, please man, James you can't move your shoe...James please don't move your shoe...if you move your shoe it could take over.' 

I laughed after that for a long time at the stupidity of that sentence. My high was still going strong at this point. I looked over to the digital clock on the TV and it read 1046PM. (NOTE: This is the only sence of time I had through the whole experience.) I then leaned back again and started looking at the holes in the walls. They began to move around all over the wall. I couldn't understand how this was happening. My heart was racing at this point. I leaned back to check the clock because watching the holes move around felt like an eternity. To my surprise it was still 1046. I relaxed once again and looked back to the wall. Then out of the holes came huge red cliffs. That is the best I can describe it. The cliffs were so tall and so vibrant. it reminded me of the grand canyon. I then looked down to the electrical sockets and they seemed to be popping out of the wall.

That is when all the visuals ended. I now felt very high. Like smoking a few bowls of KB. I took some deep breaths and looked around. I had just realized that when I was under the influance I was completely out of my body. It was like nothing existed but those neon lights. M and R were at the same stage as me by this point. We started to discuss what we had just felt. R told me half way through I began talking about riding a carosel. I don't remember talking about a carosel. Also they told me that I was saying I could rip the wall away, which I do remember experiencing, however I didn't think I told anyone. 

Through out the high themes of birth and death were abundant. I can not explain to you how they tied into my trip but I know that birth and death were a huge part of it. I also felt fear and uncertainty during the trip. Dispite this I absolutely loved what had just happened. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced. Simply put it was a mind fuck. I felt feelings of euphoria for an hour or so after the smoking. I would say the intense effects only lasted about 10 minutes. 

Now I am a salvia beliver and will be smoking it a lot in the future.

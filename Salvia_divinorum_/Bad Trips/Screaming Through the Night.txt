My friends and I had a rather difficult experience with salvia about a week ago. It really all started a few months back when we got some salvia leaves from a friend. Well, we smoked those for a while and decided they sucked so we did some research and found that 20x was a semi-popular extract to experiment with. Eventually we found a local headshop who sold up to 40x salvia. We got a gram of 20x and smoked some that day. Needless to say, the trip was rather intense. It felt kind of like a shroom body fry amplified by like 100. After that day we stashed it in my friends room and almost forgot about it until a few nights ago.

My friends and I are not much of experienced trippers, it's relatively hard to obtain psychedelics where I live, as we've only experimented with standard shroom doses in the past. So, for the most part we had no idea what we're doing.

Anyway, we are in my friends garage smoking weed for about a good 60-90 minutes, just talking about general things. There were 6 of us to begin with, and we must've smoked about a 3-4 grams of marijuana between all of us. Then suddenly we started talking about psychedelics and the salvia topic was brought up.

Anyway one of my friends had to leave, so that kind of put the whole event in motion because when my one friend left my other friend had to get up to open the garage door for him. When we're stoned we do not like to move or get up at all, and often play rock, paper, scissors to see who has to get up to do whatever task. So he remembered the salvia he had in his room and went to get it after losing to rock paper scissors. After he gets back he packs our friend J a huge bowl of 20x extract into the bong. We only had one of those cheap scripto lighters with the adjustable flame, so we put the flame on super huge and he snapped the entire bowl. His bowl was even bigger than mine and I didnt even snap mine the first time I smoked it.

Anyways, he held the smoke in his lungs for a good 10-15 seconds, and my friend B, immediatly grabbed the bong from his hands. For about a minute he just sat there with the typical retarded look on his face and mumbled to gibberish. Eventually, he started to grab his girlfriend who was sitting next to him. After about another minute he fell the the ground and had a dead mans grip on her wrist. He then began to spin on the ground, while holding her wrist this whole time, her arm was really starting to hurt and she said it's going to break, so we had to physically pull him off her. It was no easy task, this guy has military experience and is no pushover. It took 3 guys to pull him off her. Before we could get him off completely he bit his girlfriend really hard in her neck which then started to bleed. He had the look of a terrified animal in his eyes the entire trip. This was the point everyone started getting a little worried.

We tried to sit him down and calm him in any way we could, but he couldn't process what we were telling him, he was completely gone from this world. Just when we thought he was coming down, he freaked out again, about 30 seconds after we sat him down, he forced his way up and stumbled to the corner of the garage. The best way to describe this would be that he looked as if he was trying to get out, but couldn't find an exit. During this he was clawing at the wall like a freakin maniac all while screaming at the top of his lungs. This was no ordinary yell, but a primal scream of terror. The type of scream you would aim at death itself. This scream will haunt me forever. By this point his girlfriend was hysterical and frantically trying to do anything. We were all kind of like WTF do we do about this. It was really hard to hold him down because he would scream at the top of his lungs if we tried.

A few minutes passed and he seemed to be coming down again, and he actually started mumbling some english words. He then crawled under the workbench and tried to push up on it from beneath it. He pushed until the wood began splintering and my other friend, E, pressed a pressure point on his neck to subdue him. His neck was hard as a rock and did no good whatsoever, so we had to just pull him away and sit him down again.

Well, he started to scream like a banshee again and was sane enough to figure out the door to the garage and then he took off down the street. When we started hearing sirens, and we all fled the scene and went out to look for him. About 10 minutes of driving we found him running in circles in a church parking lot, and his girlfriend calmed him down long enough to get him in the car and take him home.

The next day he couldn't remember anything up to the church parking lot, he doesn't remember how he got there at all. In all, this whole episode lasted about an hour, I've never had this bad of an experience with salvia.

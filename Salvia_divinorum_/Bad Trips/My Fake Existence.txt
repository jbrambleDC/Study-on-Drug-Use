BODY WEIGHT:
170 lb





Allow me to preface by saying that none of my salvia experiences have been positive  this does not mean, though, that I am discouraged from future trials

I am a 23 year old male, who weighs approx 170 lbs. I do not think any physical measurements make any difference when it comes to this material, though. The first few times I tried salvia were with dried leaves and extract from the same company  these attempts yielded no result. When I purchased from a second shop I didnt realize that the first purchase was of dud material, and that made me go too far, I fear.

My first actual experience was with a 15x extract  big mistake. Not only that, but I took 2 huge tokes off a bong (I only did this out of skepticism, since my first three attempts failed), and this was done without a sitter (again, I didnt want to bother a friend, since it wasnt going to work). My twisted experience began about 15 seconds after the second toke on my way to my bed. It started with what seemed like an unzipping of reality  almost like a slash through my field of vision (violent) and another world was pulled around me. Weird part is that this new world looked exactly like the real one. I then blacked out and came to in my closet (about 20 feet away in another room) tearing it to shreds. I had this feeling of overwhelming terror, as if the only think I could do to put an end to whatever suffering I was going through was to end it all.

And then things started to make sense little by little as I came out of it. I looked around my room and saw that everything had been knocked over, broken, strewn across the room, and just basically trashed. I was also bleeding from several places  I assume from bumping into furniture. T+ 0 was at 12:00 am on a Friday night, and when I came out of it and realized where I was it was 2:30am. This drug is supposed to be a very short acting one  I obviously overdid it by far. I cant say that I got anything positive out of that evening at all, since I dont recall a single thing about the experience. But I do know that my body was active for the whole time  so what I really have is a memory gap and that scares the crap out of me. I am afraid that some day I might remember what it was that terrified me so.

I really wanted to know what I was missing from that experience, so I decided to do it again, but this time with less. With the 15x extract I also purchased a 5x extract  I figured that one small toke of that should be sufficient. This time I asked a friend of mine to serve as a sitter and he did so willingly. I put a very small amount of the 5x extract in my bong and took a very small toke. Within 10 seconds I was thrust back into that world of hell  I saw the saw slashing/unzipping of reality, and although I knew it was just the drug, and that reality wasnt going anywhere, it didnt help. I stood up, turned around and told my friend that it was going to be badand thats all I remember. In my mind I told him that, turned and went down to his basement where I knew it was a safer environment.

In reality, so it seems, I was ranting and raving for 20 minutes or so all around his house trying desperately to find a way out. He also said that I took a knife out of a drawer and attempted to slit my wrists before he grabbed the knife away from me (this supports my idea that I knew what I was doing at the time, but lost the memory after the fact). This time, though, I remembered more  it took me about 10 minutes to reach baseline, and for the first few I was half-in and half-out of it. I was certain my world was fake  that I was a poor psychotic who went mad years back, and that everything and everyone in my world was fakethe people actors, the environment a plywood set. I envisioned my world as a series of individual seconds strung together meticulously in order, but being built as we went. Someone messed up and the next scene of this fake life was never built  it was the end of the world, my life.

Now that I figured it all out they would have to explain it all to me. That was where the terror came from  the thought that when I went outside all the characters in my life would have to explain it to me, and that I was actually insane and since this method of treatment failed I would be confined to a mental hospital for the rest of my life. I dont know what happened during the 20 minutes or so I cant rememberbut that is what I gathered from the few minutes I do remember after the trip was coming to a close.

Salvia is not a recreational drug, I CAN tell you that. I helped me learn a lot about myself  not from the trip itself, but from the few days after the trip. Something in my head changed  and as a result the way I see the world and people around me changed. Please make sure to have a sitter  and also work your way up to the extract if leaves dont get you anywhere. Also realize that it could take up to a minute or two for a hit to register  be patient. You can always do more, but you cant go back once youve toked. Also, it has been my experience that buying from England yields MUCH better ethnobotanicals that the US, and there are many sites on the internet to purchase from  even abroad.

And to close  even after these experiences, these bad trips I am planning to try this stuff again. Except this time I will do it more slowly and with more respect for its power.

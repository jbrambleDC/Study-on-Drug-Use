I am healthy robust 55 42 year old female that does not take any medication only daily vitamin supplements and the occasional over-the-counter ibuprofen and seasonal allergy stuff. I had read all about Salvia prior to trying it. I do not like to read other peoples experiences prior to trying something new. I prefer to read about them afterwards and then compare them to my experience.

I used a tincture and then boosted by smoking a very small amount of 15x leaf. As with most inner/outer space mind experiences it is difficult to convey the powerful feelings with mere words but I will try. I smudged myself, the tincture and basically everywhere I thought I might go during the trip with sage. I also burned some incense and a small white votive candle but I did not have music playing. In the past I have found music to be a distraction from my experiences and from what I had read it would be better to lay down and ride it out. I did not want to risk hurting myself if I had to get up and turn off music.

I tried the high medium dose and held it in my mouth focusing under my tongue three different times for four minutes swallowing each diluted dose after holding it according to the instruction pamphlet that came with it. A total of approximately 540mg plus 260 mg of water to dilute is what the dose ended up being. I knew that I had a fifteen minute window before it kicked in so I was completely prepared in my bedroom and walked in there while the three minutes were still ticking on my last mouthful of tincture; I swallowed it and then immediately smoked the tiny bit that I had prepared in a small pipe for the planned boost. I held the little bit of smoke as long as I could and then sat back on my bed wanting to get there in a hurry because I could feel it coming on strong and fast.

The sensation as I sat back on my bed, which took great effort, was that some creatures were pulling me up by my hands as I was trying to lie down on my back and we were flying in space and looking at a variety of scenes. There were clouds in the night sky we were flying in. Eventually they let me land and I was running through a beautiful green pasture and I felt as though my cousins were all around me and I remember thinking that I am eleven years old and I am in the pasture of the farm that I grew up on and the question forms in my mind, whose life experience is this mine or someone elses? The returning thought was that it was all me and that everything was me and I had created it all and that time of my life was always there. I then melded with everything. I became the pasture and I could feel all of the people that I felt were there with me. It was from a moment in my childhood when I was completely free; running for the sake of running and playing for the sake of playing and life was all about innocent fun. The sensation that my deceased grandmother, father and others that I am connected to were there in essence was part of the experience too.

There was the feeling of going in and out and I remembered that I was using Salvia and then all sorts of questions started stirring and it sort of slowed everything down so I let go of thinking and allowed myself to flow with it because I wanted to continue with the experience. I now realize that I had peaked and it was starting to wear off but it was still potent because I opened my eyes and the entities that were flying with me and holding my hands were the ceiling fan and the rose from the Dahli print above my bed. The light shadows from the candle I had lit were also part of the group. As I realized I was having this experience I shut my eyes and thought about some spiritual questions and the response I saw as I was airborne looking from a wide perspective was a large gathering of pinpoints of red lights. Like a starry night but much more condensed. The feeling was that there was a lot for me to see in a short amount of time and I was flying fast. I felt as if I kept morphing in and out of watching to actually being what I was seeing.

As I started coming down I felt cold and I knew that I was not in a position to get out of bed yet so I folded my bedspread over me because that was all that I could manage at that time. I was thankful that I had dressed comfortably in warm pajamas. I realized that I did not even get the bedroom door closed and at sometime during the experience the cat had curled up next to me and I could sense its energy field and how far it extended out and the warmth it exuded. I was super sensitive to everything in the room as I kept my eyes closed and felt everything. Noises were enhanced and they were the voices during the peak. The sound of the ceiling fan kept saying, Come on, hang on, come on, hang on. and during the pasture experience my father was saying, come on as well because I remember thinking that my dad is here and I tried locating him but I couldnt because whenever I tried specifically looking for someone that I sensed was there I would be alone and they were all part of me or perhaps I was part of them and I would dissolve into the setting. That is why the question would arise as to whose life experience I was involved in. 

When I opened my eyes again I was rapidly coming down. The room was starting to return to normal but I could still catch brief glimpses of the creatures that had morphed from the fan and from my print. I looked at the clock and two hours had passed, I laid back and closed my eyes again hoping to gain some more insight and I found more intellectual thoughts forming in my mind and the experience winding down but it was immensely profound. The brief feeling that I am not separate but that I am everything and that time is some kind of portal and just beyond that portal everything that has ever been experienced is there waiting to be accessed if needed or desired.

It was definitely an experience to be respected. I got up a half hour later and went to the bathroom and then returned to bed. I was able to sleep without any problem. Respect Salvia. If it is not treated with respect I think it could be a scary journey for the mind that is full of fear for the spiritual realm or parallel universe or however you choose to name the inner/outer space place that exists within the unexplored galaxy of the conscious awakened state of mind.

When describing my experience to a friend I compared it to the intensity of DMT as it came on. Hold on because it will be the guide, definitely not the other way around. I was being taken along was the predominant sensation. I have read a great deal about ethnogens and psychedelics even though I have had limited experiences, the ones that I have had have been profound and have made lasting impressions. This is one that I will not forget anytime soon. Peace and may your explorations be insightful.

Both my friend and I had tried salvia a couple of times in the past. Usually extracts from 5x-15x strength, achieving desired effects every time. The drug fascinated us as we both seemed to come in contact with the same entities even if it was for the briefest of moments. We decided to go to the next level; the next level being the most intense psychedelic experience available to us. My friend was the first to try the 165x extract, or Dark Matter as the vender called it, however we both believed afterward that it probably wasn't that strong. It still definitely got the job done though.

The next day after his trip we decided it was my turn so we loaded up a generous amount in a bong and the experience began. I took the biggest hit I possibly could, and held it for what I believe was 30-45 seconds. Before even exhaling I felt the familiar rush that I always felt immediately after taking a hit of salvia. It wasn't anything close to a euphoric rush but more like my body was letting me know I was in for something intense. I looked at my friends and then I felt reality beginning to pull at me from all sides as the bottom half of my body began to melt into the bench I was sitting on, eventually becoming the bench as a whole. This was nothing special as I was familiar with becoming inanimate objects during previous trips, however this time there was simply no possible way for me to tilt my head downward to examine my newly obtained bench legs. My body simply decided not to obey.

Instead, I began to sink into some kind of gate. I got a brief glimpse of the gate as I fell through but I could not see what I was falling into as my body still would not budge. The moment before I came into contact with whatever this gate had brought me to, this new-found dimension became two dimensional and packed itself into the deepest corner of my brain. I returned to reality to move from my position several times as I was uncomfortable where I was sitting. I was happy my body was no longer paralyzed and after lying on the ground I told my friends 'Goodbye, as now I will return.' One of my friends said something back but the words meant absolutely nothing to me.

I was then dragged into my head, and squeezed into this all so familiar gate, where I came upon a 3D plane of reality that seemed to be made up of blocks, or legos, but I could not see close enough to find out for sure. My body was nonexistent at this point, and I did not even attempt to understand what kind of material I was now composed of. There was also a great feeling that I was no longer alone on this journey. Taking a closer look at this new world, I saw the first of this land's strange entities. It was a tall, thin, humanoid being composed of many small yellow blocks, similar, yet completely different than the material the ground was made out of. Taking a closer look at them, I saw black feathers protruding from it's head, and shortly after this observation, axes appeared in it's hand, giving it the overall appearance of a Native American warrior. At this point it became apparent that there were many, many more than just one and that this place belonged to them. I could tell they knew I was there watching them but they refused to even look at me. They were going about doing some strange task that included flattening the ground with black, intricate machines. I realized that the place I was in had to be forbidden to humans. A feeling that I was no longer welcome washed over me, frightening me a bit. One of them may have told me I was not allowed to be there. Overstaying my welcome, I was pulled from this plane back into reality by means that I could only describe as impossible, and took one last glance at these entity's long, yellow, blocky legs. 

Returning to my own realm, I felt uncomfortable because I was sweating feverously and my skin was being pricked all over, however it was all okay because I had just seen things that these majestic entities had allowed me to see out of great generosity. I tried describing what I had just experienced to my friends but it just didn't work and they later told me I had just drooled over myself when I tried to communicate with them. I got onto my feet and began walking to my friends car, being guided by my buddy who realized I had become restless and could no longer stay still. I walked to the car on a street that slanted diagonally more and more as I took each step.

When I got into the car the overwhelming feeling that I was no longer hallucinating, but still extremely high, became immediately apparent. Salvia usually only lasted 5-10 minutes during previous trips, and while salvia's trademark trance-like effects were no longer there, the after effects were much stronger this time around. I could not sit still but after being assured by my friends that it would all be over soon I began to come down little by little until I just felt dazed. The trip ended with this amazing feeling that today I had made history, and reached a place deep within myself that I may never get to see again.

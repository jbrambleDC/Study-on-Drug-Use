My first salvia divinorum experience was intense, joyful, intriguing, delightful, mysterious--and disturbing and frightening.  

Setting:  at home with three friends (2m and 2f) after spending a relaxing, yet active day sightseeing.  The two women smoked together, and later, the two men smoked together. 


NOTE 1: We should have had 1m/1f trip together instead of 2f/2m.  Both of the men were bigger and stronger than the women.  One man did not have the most pleasant trip, and he kept standing up in a state of 'fight/flight' with his fists balled ready to fight.  Had he totally freaked out, we women would not have been physically able to restrain him. 


NOTE 2:  It's been many years since I've tripped, so I decided to keep my eyes closed for my first trip to cut down on potentially frightening visuals.  I highly recommend this closed-eye method. 


NOTE 3:  I selected a meaningful mantra to repeat to myself before, during and after my trip.  I hoped a mantra would help me keep centered and calm.  My mantra was: I am safe and secure.  I am at peace with myself and with others.


Back to the trip report...

We only had a pipe, not a bong.  The smoke was so harsh that I coughed out my first hit after only a few seconds. 


Immediately upon completing my second hit I was just....gone.  All of my body, except the part that was touching the couch, was rocketed into outer space via a 'light elevator' that was much like the special effects in sci-fi movies that indicate rapid movement in an elevator within a spacecraft. 


I could feel a small part of my lower body still attached to the sofa, but the rest of me was moving, moving, moving up and out, up and out.  I was stretched to an incredible length.  I felt a lovely, tickling at my belly button and laughed with delight.  The minders reported that I laughed uproariously during the entire trip.  This vibration intensified.  I looked down and saw small dots of golden light emanating from my belly.  The vibrations continued to intensify.  The dots became small golden light arrows.  These golden light arrows streamed outward in flowing columns from my belly button.  


The number of flows continued increasing, as did the vibration.  Many of these streams simply flowed out into the cosmos, into the eternity of space.  I felt some of them entering the atmosphere of the Earth, which was far below me (but oh so beautiful and delicate and satiny blue), and of other planets I couldn't see, but knew were there, light years away, because I felt them via these arrows. I am truly unable to describe this part of the experience in words, but my heart felt terrible beauty, timelessness, and magnificence. 


Other golden arrow streams looped around and re-entered my body from the back and came out again through my belly. These arrows re-emerged and re-entered, again and again, much larger and much faster with each looping. 


The vibration was extremely intense, and the looping of the arrows was so rapid that I could no longer make out individual light arrows. There were streams of golden light flowing in and out and through my body.  The vibrations also became louder with each looping until all I could hear was a loud, incredibly deep hum. 


My body (except for that small part that was still anchored to the couch, light years away) was changing rapidly.  I was disintegrating. I was becoming pure golden energy. There was nothing I could do except let it happen.


This frightened me.  I was grateful that some small part of me was anchored back at home, and I hoped I could get back, but I didn't know how to get back home.  I thought I would probably die.  I wasn't ready to die, and didn't want to die out in space.  At the same time I felt peacefully resigned.  I was in outer space and nobody could help me.  I was alone, yet connected to everything and everybody--as pure energy.  I wondered if I would actually die, or if I would continue to exist.


And then--it was over. Elapsed Earth time: 18 mins.  Tripsense Time: Eternity. 


For the rest of the evening I had strong feelings of peace and serenity, and some sadness.

DOSE:
2 bowls
smoked
Salvia divinorum






My previous attempts at having an experience on Salvia were a bust so I decided I wouldn't quit smoking till something happened. I sat down with my shitty homemade bong in my room. Its bowl is an actual tobacco pipe so it holds a little more than a 'bowl.'  I think I had polished off two bowls when I realized something was happening. I looked around my room to see if anything looked different.  Everything seemed the same but when I looked all the way to my left, my head froze in place and suddenly my whole body grew tense. I started to freak out a little at not being able to move but quickly reminded myself that it was just the drug and I should just let it ride.

I closed my eyes and quit stuggling. That's when I realized that the tension of my whole body was just because I was turning into a tree (an oak tree!). The bark crept up my neck and my arms turned into branches. I could hear myself growing and creaking under the strain.  I soon realized that I, as a tree, was in a forest beside a small brook. It must have been fall because most of the other trees' leaves were covering the ground.  The thing about this forest was that I actually didn't 'see' it, it was more like a picture in my imagination that remained for the time I was under. Still, I knew it was a drug-induced visual. 

Being a tree taught me how to live. It's really hard to explain it beyond that, but it was truly a mystical experience. I had a similar lesson with acid but Salvia was much more gentle and earthly. I'm not sure how long I was a tree. It felt like only a few minutes but I'm sure it could have been much longer. I felt really good about the experience afterwards and I plan on doing it again.

Having tried regular Salvia divinorum without the trip I had heard so much about, I bought one Gram of Salvia 10X.

At about 1:30 AM, I took one gram of Fly Agaric 10X. I felt nothing, and continued to feel nothing for about an hour and a half, so I decided to try my Salvia 10X. Before that, I took a pinch of the Mua Huang 5x foliage so I would not fall asleep during the trip. Everyone else was sleeping. I went outside, loaded my water bong and smoked the Salvia with a blowtorch. Immediately, the effects where noticable, similar to Marijuana, so much that I wondered if I was smoking Marijuana instead of Salvia. After the first bowl, I was pretty buzzed and hadn't really tripped yet. I went inside for about 5 minutes, then went out for another bowl.

I lit my bowl and I remember my Blow Torch and my Waterbong talking to me. I remember my waterbong looking like it was expanding to a triangular shape, and it was kind of red. I came to, and I said 'woah'. I felt like I was an outsider to the conversation. Then, I remember feeling like I was trapped in a position, and it was impossible to move. I was in an alternate dimension it seemed. I tried to turn arround but I could not. Then, I remember trying to shift myself, and I did, and I felt pain. I thought I put my hand through my deck and chopped off one of my fingers. I touched what I thought was my severed finger on the deck. I began to worry a little, but I did not see my finger. I was relieved to know that I had not severed my finger. Then I put my bong down and went to go inside, holding my still lit blow torch. As I got close to the door, I was locked in a position again and everything seemed to be repeating. I slipped into the alternate dimension again. Eventually, I came to, and blew out the blow torch, turned the valve off, and grabbed my waterbong.

I felt like hands where grabbing me, preventing me from going inside. I stumbled into the back door, and went upside. I still felt like hands where grabbing me, and I had to be careful what I did, or they would restrict me. I would probably guess what I felt is what a psychotic episode is like. I put my bong and blowtorch away and turned on some music, and laid down. I had mild visuals when I closed my eyes.

I was beginning to come down, and after about a half an hour, I was relatively close to baseline. My finger still hurt. The next day, I realised there was a large blister where I thought it went through the deck. I am not sure exactly what happened, but I think my finger probably touched the hot water bong bowl or something.

In conclusion, Salvia 10X is a very interesting substance to experiment with, but I must stress the importance of a sitter from this experience. It is too easy to injure yourself not knowing what you are doing otherwise, especially if you are holding a lit blow torch in one hand. I am glad that I did not injure myself very badly, however the blister on my finger will be a reminder to have a sitter present next time. I was totally unprepared for the experience, although it was enjoyable to take a break from reality.

The Mua Huang also prevented me from going to sleep until about 6 AM.
